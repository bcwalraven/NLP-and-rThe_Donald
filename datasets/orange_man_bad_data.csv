god_emperor_jeb,"The left/right dichotomy only serves the elites. It typically beings nothing valuable to a discussion and usually just causes an argument about semantics. It promotes “orange man bad” tier dialogue. 

Any solution to the issue of the left is automatically left wing because it involves the government actually doing something. Building a wall is left wing socialist because it involves taking billions in tax dollars, government controlling people (despite the fact that they’re illegal), etc. 

Having a traditional family unit (the only actual functioning way to have a healthy family) is also very left wing because the father acts as an authoritarian figure that has power over the rest of the family. They don’t even get to vote.

The only thing that is “right wing” is to allow corporations, banks, and other hostile entities to make slaves out of us all, but it’s okay because the government has slightly less power than one that actually could do its job.  this is the purpose of the left/right dichotomy.

I think so too.


I live in a *very* liberal area of Dallas with many Commiefornia transplants. I attended an NYE party in which I was probably the only Trump voter present. I have been to many gatherings like this before, and was prepared to hear all the typical NPC anti-Trump bullshit for a good part of the night.


Oddly enough, not once in the 5 hours I was at the party did I hear *a single mention* of politics. Not one. No orange man bad, no nothing.

LMAO so absolutely true.

To rant about this for a sec...

As a former loser, I've come to realize that SJWs are basically pre-BTTF George McFlys living in a bubble together.  They've subconsciously associated ""winning"" with ""leaving the comfort zone"" and thus, anxiety.

If you're good at something, don't waste time, just tell them you're good, and take the stick out.  ""Hey boss, what's up.  Say, I'm really good at organizing folders in case you ever need someone to do that.""  Maybe your boss will have you do that, maybe not.  But you present your boss with a potential winning situation that you both can benefit from.

But the SJW doesn't know what it's like to be good at something, nor how to SELL being good at something.  If you want to get something done, just dive right in and communicate your skill level so you can be put to better use OR even better, manage a business of your own.

**TLDR**: SJW hears someone sell themselves, they have no grasp for business-context and thus assume ""oh, he MUST be bragging.""  Then time goes by and their narrative of ""orange man bad"" snowballs and thus it legitimately BAFFLES them as to why anyone would see Trump differently, because their lens of ""Trump the braggart"" gets more detailed and colorful over time.",2019-01-01,1,The_Donald

Beepboopcomrad,"Let’s take a journey into the mind of the Incel Vaper. 

Firstly, Incel Vaper most be proud of his job. It’s a hip lax place. Perfect for the low energy soy boi. This creates entitlement and a superiority complex. 

The Incel Vaper makes contact with the Chad Trumpster. His NPC chip is overclocking at this point. Orange man bad indeed. 

The Incel Vaper now attempts to establish his intellectual dominance by refusing to grant the Chad Trumpster service. The RL equivalent of “you are now banned from r/politics for posting in T_D.” 

Oh Incel Vaper, this is not the internet. 

Bewildered by his demands being rejected, the Incel Vaper went to personal attacks. “Racist!” he cries out in attempt to dehumanize the Chad Trumpster and forcing him to leave. 

He is now completely out of control, and being denied the very thing he wants most. For the Chad Trumpster to cower and leave, leaving him looking victorious in the eyes of the black patron watching from the side. Surly this will score him virtue signaling points. 

Silly beta, that’s not how this works. 

The NPC’s processor is starting to catch up to the situation. Having discovered the realization.exe of being recorded at work in real life. His minimal resources dedicated to logic are now slightly grasping the possible consequences. 

The Incel Vaper is unwilling to concede and correct it’s NPC behavior. It now acts out of fear, hoping to begrudgingly complete the transaction somehow maintaining power and saving face. 

The Chad Trumpster sees an opportunity to claim victory. “Capitalism wins again!” He proclaims. These three words of truth overload the NPC’s hardware causing a catastrophic crash of the operating system. 

The Incel Vaper is left with no other option than to Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee as loudly as it can.

PresidentPreston,"She’s obviously delaying her retirement purely because Trump would name her replacement. There’s no other reason. It’s not because she still enjoys the gig (she might, but that’s not why she’s staying), nor because her mind is still sharp and competent (it might be, but that’s not why she’s staying). She’s staying entirely because she doesn’t want Donald Trump to name her replacement. 

Put it another way. If Hillary were President, RBG would’ve stepped down already. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it.

And that’s sad because:

1) it’s not in her best physical interest. I gotta believe her health would be better served if she could focus only on recovery.

2) it’s not in her best legacy interest. RBG is an important figure to the history of the Court, and *this* is how she’s gonna write her last chapter? As a partisan hack hanging on simply so orange man bad can’t name her replacement? This petty nonsense is beneath her.

3) it’s not in the Court’s best interest. Obviously her ability to hear and decide cases is impeded right now. How is this fair to the defendants pleading their case, or the attorneys who’ve prepped for their day in court? 

4) it’s not in America’s best interest as it sets a precedent that we should expect justices to remain on life support until a Presidential election goes their way. 

I say all that, and yet, personally.... I sure as hell didn’t want Obama filling Scalia’s seat. And if it’s Clarence Thomas hanging on by a thread the next time we have a Dem President, I’ll be personally rooting for the life support machine too. 

Ben Sasse was right during the Kavanaugh hearing: because our system is broken at the Congressional level, the American people have been forced to put all their hopes into the Supreme Court. It shouldn’t be this way, but it is. And so we live in this world of cognitive dissonance where everything I said about the sadness of what RBG is doing is true, but I also understand it perfectly and would want Clarence Thomas to do the same thing.",2018-12-26,1,The_Donald

So, as someone stated “Orange man play golf. Orange man bad. Black man play golf, black man bad” is a proper argument. 

The Left will immediately scream “great whataboutism” as a means of shutting down your argument. As if your counterargument is invalid (which it is not.)

I should note, 90% of the time you see “whataboutism” or “strawman” written on Reddit, it is by a Leftist who refuses to have an earnest conversation - mostly because he has no answers to his clear hypocrisy/double standard. ",2018-12-27,1,The_Donald

I've had some ""inapporpiate"" talks with her don't get me wrong but nothing even close to suggesting action, or anything like that. Just talks of times past with her and marriage now, and venting and bs like that. She'd be the one to say I abused her by not _____________ when ____________ or some bullshit like that.

Oughthere,"Any deviation in the code used in the programming could create a firestorm of other NPCs angered their programming was not properly updated. All updated programming must be congruent. 

If even one NPC fails to be properly updated with the latest programmed propaganda it could completely derail the narrative. Being that both NancyNPC and Chuck NPC were updated simultaneously, the other NPCs understand that this is the new programmed narrative. However, if NancyNPC and Chuck NPC were to have different programming this could cause a short circuit amongst the other NPCs and disrupt the entire narrative.

Ex/ “Orange man bad” is always the universal programming but if it were “Orange man is mostly bad” that leaves room for questioning. Perhaps the NPC may say “if he is mostly bad that means he’s not all bad”. Other NPCs May begin to do the same. A recall of 60 million updates would be very costly and time consuming. Not to mention, it would postpone the newest updated programming leaving some NPCs completely helpless because they wouldn’t know what to say in the face opposing views. I think this is why some NPCs call ppl Nazis. Their programming has been outdated since the 1940s. They live in 2018 but are using a software update from the era of the third Reich.

ButtFart88,"He knew this would be big which is why he planned it for the shut down. Trump has actually been very meticulous in his plan to deprogram the left.

Phase 1: build report as a competent leader. Increase gross domestic product, lower unemployment, renegotiate trade deals. Increase the pocketbooks of Americans and give the supporters some facts to work with. Make opponents uneasy that maybe orange man not so bad.

Phase 2: go on offense. Legalize hemp, pass prison justice reform, move out of Syria. Basically gets a favorable action to stoners, black people (who are disproportionally effected by the prison system) and pretty much everybody. He also timed this during the shut down for 2 reasons. One it puts the pressure on the democrats to fold in the wall, and 2 he wanted as much favorable actions as possible during a very intensive area from an attention point of view. He knew the shutdown would get all eyes on him so it’s a great time to do these 3 great things and make sure the word gets out.

2019 is a mystery. If Ruth Bader Ginsburg passes away or retires it’ll most likely be the year of the Supreme Court. But anything else he has planned is a mystery.

2020 will most likely be declass as well as anything else he has planned. As well the debates, which aren’t so much something he has planned out. But a huge time to inform the general public all the good he has done and cement his re-election.

Fucked me out of a mid five figure amount of money, dropped out of school, told her student loans to fuck off, can't hold a job to save her life, has 4 kids from at least 3 different fathers, has massive health issues stemming from being like 200 pounds overweight and she's not even 30 yet.

She called me to of course ask for money. She's behind on her bills and can't afford to give her kids anything for Christmas. Of course since her current boyfriend is a federal employee (he's basically a janitor) making $15/hr tops and the government shut down, they are even more behind. She was raging at trump over that. I told her you do realize that he's getting all that money in backpay, 100% of it. He is literally getting a paid vacation. She had no idea, all she knew was orange man bad. Then she went on to say oh it's bullshit that he's doing this in Christmas. I told her that's exactly what Obama did with the ACA, and look at the disaster the ACA is. She says that the ACA is great for her because she can get healthcare for her and her 4 kids for free. I tell her too bad it sucks for literally anyone else because ironically enough they can't afford it. She asks me for some money again, I say no, the trump market crash (LOL) really hurt my portfolio and I'm struggling myself. Then she asked me if I wanted to go to her apartment to spend Christmas with her and her boyfriend and kids and asked if I can bring a few things (just the food for everyone).

Sorry, that’s ridiculous. 

We have a solid 5-4 SCOTUS majority, a strong incoming Senate majority, and the Presidency.  When the inevitable happens, we will have all the tools needed to cement constitutional conservatism even more firmly in American jurisprudence. 

But I see absolutely no redeeming value in thrashing someone when they’re down — it’s not like it’s going to speed the process along. 

RBG is not some far-left political operative, BS-peddling journalist, dossier-maker, corrupt FBI official, homicidal NY state senator, or Eric Swalwell-type cuck.  

There’s a lot of Democrats out there that will do anything to brand me and my President a Russia-loving racist using whatever faked garbage they can think of.  But she’s not one of them — and if there’s any liberals out there where I feel comfortable “agreeing to disagree,” it’s with her. 

I’ll go to war against the opposition insofar as they feel the need to go to war against me — but America’s still big enough for intelligent liberals who have cogent, but different, political views and judicial philosophy.

I love how speechless they go when they start saying how trumps destabilising the world and I point out Hillary wanted troops on the ground in Syria, wanted to shoot down Russian jet and the only time she’s praised Trump is after he fired 56 cruise missiles into a Syrian military base.

Digitalalchemyst,"Where to start...

Gun control: I am a firm believer in the 2nd amendment. Ask Venezuela how giving up thier guns turned turned out.

Abortion: I don’t support abortion. I think it is morally wrong. I wasn’t raised religious so my reasoning isn’t from a religious standpoint. Just seems kinda wrong from a nature standpoint.
Late term abortion should be banned but I don’t support legislating it out of existence. To me it’s more about education.

Also this...
http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/

Immigration: Illegal immigration hurts minorities and the lower class and benefits big business and multinational corporations. Putting business before the needs of a countries citizenry is wrong. It is also a matter of national security and of public health.

Climate Change: The climate changes. It’s been really hot and really cold in the past. Is man impacting the climate. Sure. How much? Probably not much. 

Should we look for new forms of energy? Definely! Are there any forms of energy that are less harmful and as efficient as oil on a global scale? Not even close.

Look at the Paris climate treaty and the reaction of German automakers and you begin to realize the whole thing is just a massive transfer of wealth and does nothing for the environment.

President Trump is the first politician in my lifetime that does what he says. He can’t be bought. He fights for America. Every country should want a leader like that.

 His knowledge of economics and trade and the team he has put together are unrivaled. He truly is making America great economically.

I just generally find him funny and to be a good person. I have always thought he was funny and being from the east coast have always been familiar with the many good things he’s done. I find the hate of him to be completely irrational which makes it hard to take people seriously: There might be legit policy issues people have but when Orange Man bad is all I hear I lose a bit of respect for people. I actually feel sorry for people who are so consumed with hate because they have actually just bought into the marketing of the progressive agenda. 

Why do you hate him? What is rational about hating someone you’ve never met?

0IMGLISSININ,"All good points, but I don't think it outweighs the risks of withdrawing. I don't think anybody knows how many ISIS members remain, they've been greatly destabilized so even they might not know for sure. More than likely they become cells that will grow to be somewhat self sufficient, fortifying their foundation as they reconnect with the others.

I think Russia's presence is a self serving one, largely because of Putin's support of Assad, who has committed war crimes against his own citizens, and our military's interactions with theirs. But maybe I'm wrong, again I can't really say.

As for the left and right, I agree politicians all have their influences and faults, but I think there's more too it than just losing money and ""orange man bad"".

If I had to guess, the ones with those motivations are make up a minority (but maybe a vocal majority, not sure). Both sides are saying the same things, and many of the quieter politicians are making themselves heard.

Finally, we SHOULD build ourselves up, but not at the expense of allowing a dangerous adversary to recover their more strength and influence. This move opens the door to both.

I don't think we should be there any longer than is necessary, any amount of losses are too many, but it's important to remember that our allies make up the majority of deaths these days, not US soldiers. Allies who now have to fend for themselves, and who don't have the luxury to leave because it is their home and probably wouldn't if they could.

In other words this opened up elections to foreign money, something that had been happening for years yet only Trump gets blamed for Russian interference to the tune of a measly $4700 spent on some Facebook ads.

Just a little concerned about potential for turkey to attack the YPJ and YGP who are only second to Russia in success against ISIS and their affiliates (U.S coalition on some occasions actually ended up helping and even funding ISIS and AN just like it did AQ and they were most definitely not as effective as Russia) the US has a bad, bad history of forgetting its allies. Ask any US service personnel how the afghani translators and intel gatherers were treated; they saved lives and got hung out to dry. Many have been killed by the taliban.

I just hope Iran can btfo off of israel and just let israel keep doing what its doing so the global community will finally take notice and united action against israel and its criminal actions. Perhaps it might lead to a two state solution and finally a peace which would be an amazing legacy for Trump to leave especially if he can help broker it.

DirkCNNholeDiggler,"I hope your right.  I am NOT a concern troll.  I swear that on my mother and father as well as my wife and kids :-) ... 

I've hit a point where I don't think the DS is going to get their comeuppance.  

The DS has their little manufactured story about bad orange man paying his hooker to influence the election.  The media, once they get their orders, are going to pummel the public with that, equate it to Monica Lewinsky, and give the Dems the cover they need to impeach Trump.

The Dems will proceed with impeachment ... That's their plan.  The GOP helped them by giving Dems a larger margin in the House and not contesting the abject bullshit that happened in the aftermath of the election.  While the Dems certainly won the House, the ""found votes"" that swung all of those elections to Dems to give them a +40 seat gain vs a low +30s gain was nonsense.  Losing Senate seats in Montana and AZ were orchestrated.  The GOP has done NOTHING.  They want this as much as the Dems.

I think they want a year long narrative to thrash Trump even more ... That'll allow them to begin impeachment in late 2019 and will completely wreck his 2020 campaign.  I know Trump's a fighter, but having impeachment hanging around your neck while campaigning in the primary (you know damn well they'll run Kasich and some other pansy ass dickstains against him) is going to be a pretty difficult cross to bare.

If Trump has any cards to play against the DS, it had better start in January or else we are fucked.  Completely fucked.  Like capital F fucked.  Releasing information that can thwart the impeachment narrative is almost mandatory at this point. ",2018-12-19,1,The_Donald

I honestly think its because of his now record approval among Republicans, as anyone with half a brain knows rightwingers or left-wingers dont win elections...independents do. 

Election season his overall republican approval rating was (and this was after he won the nomination and election) wasn't much higher than 50 percent if i remember correctly, it probably wasn't even that high (people forget Jeb Bush was actually the republican frontrunner for the majority of the primaries until trump pummelled bush  and pushed him aside like the garbage neocon he is. What needs to be noted that at the nomination literally non- or almost next to none of that 50% were Bush voters who switched to Trump after their beloved Neocon idol was irrelevant- a bush voter is a bush voter, a change of whole worldview overnight from Neoconservatism/Nevertrump to Populist Nationalism/Anti interventionism aint happening.

Now what do we see today? all these loud and brash voices during the election season towards our movement only becoming stronger and more deafening than they already were? No, as you of course know,quite  the opposite, and that is a BAD thing, probably as bigger danger, if not as big as the left currently is.... ""But more votes is a good thing""  Of course, generally speaking in a normie election cycle,in a normie country in a normie year, yes,  it is. But most definately not in this case...why? well to sum up in a metaphor its ""poisoning the well"" (our movement). It is in my opinion what we are seeing here is the result of the slow capitulation of the Nevertrump neocons, their propagandist mouthpieces in the media, and their as you say ""right wing NPC"" followers. They have finally realized...taken them a good two years to learn that they cant beat trump, so they might as well join him to at-least stay relevant and maybe have a little bit of sway in what goes on, rather than virtue signalling about how orange man bad and crying themselves to sleep at night because of how irrelevant they are becoming.  Why? because Neocons are just leaching, spineless leftists in sheeps clothing(and most of them dont even know it), and they crave nothing but power... so naturally they are in favor of wherever the power structure is at the current time...which is...well you know that part. (Note: I know you guys above know all of this, i just posted this as somewhat of a guide to any unsure pedes/people on the fence, who are just as annoyed about this fiasco that is this post as we are and are looking out for some pointers/answers, not just mindless group-think as seen everywhere here in this post, save for a few oasis's like this,cheers.)",2018-12-18,1,The_Donald

lordxela,"Back before the election, I demonstrated to show my liberal friends how crap Obamacare was, they kept supporting it so sincerely. We have some young Canadians in our group as well, it wasn't helping. 

I went and made an account on Healthcare.gov, just to see what I, a single male student, could get, and it didn't make sense. Like what many others here are saying, I'd pay $650 a month and pay $6500 before I got any assistance from our new socialized healthcare.

And when I got down to it and asked each friend who was using Obamacare, none of them were. They all had better health insurance through their parents or employers. So my well meaning friends were actually pushing something they didn't even need. Noble of them, I guess, but I showed them that the ""poor people"" they were supporting were actually getting grilled harder than us single students. One friend even contacted his mother's boyfriend who owned an HVAC business, oof, did he learn what was happening to small business owners.

Orange man still bad though, of course.

These are middle school children, they know nothing of politics and it should remain as such. They should be focusing on school, sports, playing with friends, etc.

RuraliteConvert,"You mean learning all the 'smart' perspectives and adopting the trappings of an academic doesn't make me intelligent? But, look at my taste in coffee. It's so refined. I enjoy a wide variety of cheeses that nobody can pronounce. I read the cleverest modern literature on public transportation, straight out of the New Yorker's recommendations. My overcoat has leather elbows and my shoes are a rough brown leather that indicate I'm both sophisticated yet disheveled in just the right ratio. How can I not be an intellectual?

I read Guns Germs and Steel, and it's my response to literally every historical discussion that I'm not familiar with. It's my go-to answer to anything that seems to contradict my worldview. I mean, we all know that Africa would be a thriving civilization if 16th century trade routes hadn't built roads that only head to the coasts. This lack of inter-village travel simply isolated their population centers and turned them into exploitable capitalist economic nodes instead of an integrated network of intra-continental trade. That's what my professor said, and he's very smart. Colonialism bad.

As you can tell from my sophisticated use of niche terminology lifted directly from authors I'm assigned to read, my vocabulary is comparable to that of Shakespeare, while my wit is as sharp as Oscar Wilde. I read *The Importance of being Earnest* my freshman year, and my Literature TA pointed out all the clever wordplay and I immediately pointed it out to my friends as though I'd noticed it all by myself, without guidance from anyone - even the period-specific terminology that I couldn't possibly have untangled on my own. I'm simply that intelligent. And yes, I actually enjoy *Ulysses*, thank you very much.

I also bask in European art film's slow yet tempered pace. I will sit through a 2-minute shot of water lapping at the shore while Philip Glass music plays, whereas your attention span requires at least 6 shot changes per minute or you get bored. I guess all that time spent watching experimental art theater has trained my tastes in a way you can't comprehend. And that's why you'll never understand that Orange man bad.",2018-12-13,1,The_Donald

They can't control their minions. After all this time of encouraging them to screech at authority figures and disrupt official government business, the Icons Of The Tolerant Left™ were stupid to think their Noisy Privileged Contrarians would suddenly discover decorum and selectively behave just for their Leftist Leaders. 



No amount of pandering will ever be sufficient, because now they will have to deal with the ever-changing demands of every special interest group/identity politics faction that they have unwisely promised 100% compliance. And this is going to be ~~difficult~~ hilarious because in the real world, those demands will inevitably contradict. 



The close proximity of ""Diversity"" and ""Unity"" are going to clash in a big clattering mess of cognitive dissonance and *reeeeee* the minute these short-attention-span triggerbrats shift their focus from their common enemy. When the screechers lose track of the hate that binds them together (*""Orange Man Bad! reeeee""*) and start obsessing on their demands, the Leftist Leaders are going to be dealing with a foul-tempered undisciplined plus-sized kindergarden class of thousands that know how Bic lighters work. 



tl;dr We saw this coming, they did not. The day Bernie Sanders got his microphone taken away, it was obvious that this was the appetizer for The Left eating its own. The Left just encouraged the rabble-rousing and riots, and now the payment is due. The programmers of the NPCs never considered that one day, that would mean:

sun_wolf,"It’s not even really about making a believable case either. They just want the constant negative noise. The corporate media/Deep State/globalist cabal understands that most people don’t follow the news. I used to think most people just read headlines (not articles) and watch late-night comedy shows for all their news. But now I think it’s even worse than that. Most people don’t even read the headlines, and instead of watching The Daily Show, they just watch the ads for The Daily Show that run in between the cartoon shows. So all they hear is “Orange Man Bad” and “Orange Man Scandal” every day and the details don’t matter, because the details are never looked at. 

Comedy Central was running an ad for The Daily Show a couple months ago that was maybe 10 seconds long. It was a highlight reel of anti-Trump gags and one of them was the North Korea peace deal. And they ran this ad once every commercial break. That’s it. That’s all it takes. President Trump brokers peace in North Korea, bringing an end to the Korean War after fifty years, and they turn it into a ten-second attack ad airing 500 hundred times a day to college kids watching cartoons. Just a picture of Trump and Un shaking hands and Trevor Noah looking into the camera smugly. And he goes, “Uh, really?” And the audience bursts out in jeering hostile language laughter. And the college kid watching cartoons thinks the President did something awful. He doesn’t know what the picture is, who the guy he’s shaking hands with, or what any of this means or represents. He doesn’t know what the Korean War even was. But he saw Trevor Noah being smug and he heard that jeering laughter and we knows he wants to be on the side of the mob so he hates Drumpf right alongside them.

If you have done research, good on you- I just cant get over the amount of destruction they cause vs a statement of safety given by WHO/CDC overlords.

Regardless, the amount of vax-related injuries per year is staggering... This gets no attention and is swept under the rug.. Not to mention countless number of injuries that either go undocumented or are classified as unrelated (i mention that because in all likelihood, they aren't unrelated at all - suddenly developing seizure disorder after a round of vaccines? ok!)... Sick of seeing this sentiment towards antivax notion on T_D. . . with abundant amount of libertarians and conservatives here its honestly surprising.

Short answer - interpreting the statute the way you're trying to interpret it would make almost every action (or inaction) a campaign finance violation.  That's not how this works, and that's not the precedent for how an in kind contribution is defined in practice.  As OP pointed out, you're being willfully obtuse in your questions and follow up questions.

An in-kind contribution has to be directly linked to a campaign - OP laid out a few examples of this - focus groups, call centers, canvassers - you know, things that you could legally spend campaign money on.  Just because something influences an election doesn't make it a campaign expense.

That and ""When in the course of human events"" and all that so if the French people legitimately feel that rioting is the right way to go about things when it comes to opposition to Macron's policies (which I can sympathize with) I am not going to stop them. Especially since local police sided with the protesters in this. Rioting (followed by revolution) should only be followed up when it is legitimately true that the state is incapable and unwilling to carry out its duties to the people in its social contract with said people.

&amp;#x200B;

If the hypothetical democratic riot you are referring to was just another series of chanting ""orange man bad"" and ""he hurt my feelings"" then no because that is childish and shows that they are just overgrown children. I would only support a riot against *any* President if his policies were legitimately a detriment to the United States and showed that he abandoned his duty to the American People and that protesting it did not work. It is always legitimate to protest a President when you disagree with his *policies* but rioting must be reserved for certain matters otherwise it is a simple act of lawlessness.

nakedjay,"&gt;Obama didn’t just separate children, he actually [placed children with human](http://archive.is/qr0Jf) traffickers

“The Obama administration failed to protect thousands of Central American children who have flooded across the U.S. border since 2011, leaving them vulnerable to traffickers and to abuses at the hands of government-approved caretakers, a Senate investigation has found.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, failed to do proper background checks of adults who claimed the children, allowed sponsors to take custody of multiple unrelated children, and regularly placed children in homes without visiting the locations, according to a 56-page investigative report released Thursday.

And once the children left federally funded shelters, the report said, the agency permitted their adult sponsors to prevent caseworkers from providing them post-release services.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) initiated the six-month investigation after several Guatemalan teens were found in a dilapidated trailer park near Marion, Ohio, where they were being held captive by traffickers and forced to work at a local egg farm. The boys were among more than 125,000 unaccompanied minors who have surged into the United States since 2011, fleeing violence and unrest in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.”

““It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Portman said in a written statement. “What makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

“The report was released ahead of a hearing Thursday before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which Portman co-chairs with Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). It detailed nearly 30 cases where unaccompanied children had been trafficked after federal officials released them to sponsors or where there were “serious trafficking indicators.”

“HHS places children with individuals about whom it knows relatively little and without verifying the limited information provided by sponsors about their alleged relationship with the child,” the report said. For example, one Guatemalan boy planned to live with his uncle in Virginia. But when the uncle refused to take the boy, he ended up with another sponsor, who forced him to work nearly 12 hours a day to repay a $6,500 smuggling debt, which the sponsor later increased to $10,900, the report said.

A boy from El Salvador was released to his father even though he told a caseworker that his father had a history of beating him, including hitting him with an electrical cord. In September, the boy alerted authorities that his father was forcing him to work for little or no pay, the report said; a post-release service worker later found the boy was being kept in a basement and given little food.

The Senate investigation began in July after federal prosecutors indicted six people in connection with the Marion labor-trafficking scheme, which involved at least eight minors and two adults from the Huehuetenango region of Guatemala.

One defendant, Aroldo Castillo-Serrano, 33, used associates to file false applications with the government agency tasked with caring for the children, and bring them to Ohio, where he kept them in squalid conditions in a trailer park and forced them to work 12-hour days, at least six days a week, for little pay. Castillo-Serrano has pleaded guilty to labor-trafficking charges and awaits sentencing in the Northern District of Ohio in Toledo.”

But Orange Man Bad.

_-Th0r-_,"He was Persian, and they had a much deeper cultural history pre-Islam (Darius and Xerxes are household names to anyone who has taken Western Civ I).  Ibn Sina is another example of a Persian of significant influence, particular in medicine.  The Levant had a rich history, as well.  The Arabian peninsula ... I never studied anything about civilizations in the Arabian peninsula pre-Islam, and that's probably because there wasn't much going on.

&amp;#x200B;

As stated in my original comment, their Golden Age spanned a time when you could be an observing Muslim and dedicate your life to secular studies.  This eventually became an impious pursuit, and hello dark ages.  So it was secular dedication that mattered.  And as I stated, it was almost entirely because they had access to Greek and Roman academic works.

&amp;#x200B;

You are right to be suspect of Islamic propaganda, but it is certifiably true that they had a Golden Age.  They also destroyed a lot of Western works, but that's what we get for losing the Eastern Empire.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of the propaganda to not fall for ... I was in an Islamic Studies center in an Islamic country with my class of American history majors, where the Islamic Studies prof was going on about how noble and benign life was under Muslim rule in territories that had a lot of Christian and Jewish populations.  

&amp;#x200B;

He specifically cited Andalusian Spain.  A classmate had just finished his senior thesis debunking this myth citing primary sources that laid out the barbarism of Islamic rule in Spain and in particular Andalusia.  

&amp;#x200B;

That's a legit historical criticism.  The ""orange man bad"" reaction to anything about Islam that is backed up with lots of history is like saying Jesus never existed, when the historicity of Jesus is virtually uncontested.  ",2018-12-06,1,The_Donald

Ever since that, I began to look at more and more rallies and more and more protests to see how passionate, patriotic, and delusional people were, respectively. Protests that had no other reasoning to them other than ORANGE MAN BAD, hateful business owners not allowing MAGA hats within their grounds, leftists beating on Trump supporters, and the quick rise of modern day Antifa.

What essentially threw away the key (and I will never forget this) was Bernie not only being socialist, but the fact that he betrayed his supporters to support Hillary. I am not necessarily republican, however many of my values derive from many of you repub/conservatives.",2018-12-04,1,The_Donald

MCScottyB,"You lack knowledge of the auto industry and know not of what you speak. It’s almost like the “Orange Man Bad” NPC meme. “GM bad because muh Mary Barra.” If you actually took the time to study how the Democrats and their policies almost destroyed the US auto industry, you might be singing a different tune. GM got a bailout because credit was frozen  and they could not get a line of credit to restructure (like Ford was able to do a year or so before the economic collapse as they neared bankruptcy themselves). 
What caused the collapse? Democrat policies where folks who shouldn’t have ever gotten mortgages received them and banks ran wild. We know the rest. Another contribution to its bankruptcy was $1200 or so per car in sunk costs for healthcare because Democrat policies would not allow tort reform or any meaningful reform on healthcare to drive down costs. Also Democrats blocking any meaningful energy policy and drilling helped us hit $5 per gallon gas prices right before the bankruptcy, which cratered truck and SUV sales.  All of these things drove the Big 3 to the brink. Your comment about “crap cars” nobody wants is antiquated thinking. Buick knocked Lexus out of the #1 spot for initial quality in the JD Power survey the year of the bankruptcy. Lexus held the spot 10 years in a row. 
One cannot sprinkle fairy dust and overnight retool a factory in the US because muh, reasons. it costs billions to retool a factory so the decision must be made with care. Many of the overseas operations of all the car manufacturers is due to them moving into a more favorable regulatory environment. Again, thanks to democrat policies, we had to offshore manufacturing because the regulatory environment was too stifling here. 
So many of you reflexively hate GM because you’re not fully informed. I wonder why it’s ok for the banks who caused this mess and received $800billion in a bailout under Bush and TRILLIONS in bailouts under Obama (QE at $85billion a month) don’t earn the scorn and derision you hurl at GM?! 
You all seem fixated on GM. We should be uniting behind our domestic auto manufacturers and doing everything in our power to stop Democrat idiocy (50 mpg for trucks on CAFE or be fined into oblivion anyone?) that harms the industry. I don’t care if Mary Barra is a Democrat.  That’s immaterial. The Board could remove her tomorrow if they thought she was doing a bad job. As painful as it is, consumer tastes have shifted away from cars and more into SUV’s and GM has to align their manufacturing to reflect this market reality. It’s called capitalism. It’s messy, disruptive, and sometimes unpleasant. But it beats socialism and other lefty commie crap hands down. Downvote me into oblivion. I don’t care. The leftists all drive Toyota (Tom Friedman said Toyota should run GM) and the uninformed on the right hate GM because muh, bailout and I’m sitting here saying most of this crap wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for Democrats and it falls on deaf ears.

LORD_RM,"I don’t understand how this latest ‘revelation’ from Mueller / FBI / Cohen is anything. 

1. He was raided MONTHS ago by the FBI. Anything they know they would have known long ago. This would mean that either.
A) Cohen had some secret evidence hidden somewhere that the FBI never found until now. (Seems totally ridiculous)
B) Mueller or someone in the FBI had this information the whole time and just leaked it now to the media. (Possible, but unlikely since there hasn’t been any ‘bad’ Russia news for a while, so why would they wait this long)
C) Cohen is still talking out of his ass and doing everything he can to get the best deal for himself. (Makes sense because people do what is best for them, especially scumbag lawyers)

2. Does anyone believe Cohen about anything? If Cohen is being charged with perjury, how are they going to turn around and then use him as the key witness for this claim. If Cohen had any transcript or audio recording, then how did Cohen hide it for so long or why would Mueller/FBI just leak it now? 

3. If Mueller was just able to ‘checkmate’ GEOTUS by making this move after he turned in his answers to Muellers questions, then why would GEOTUS ever even turn in answers knowing he would incriminate/perjure himself? That means that:
A) Stupid bad orange man Drumpf finally got caught in his web of lies and didn’t know or forgot that Cohen or the FBI had evidence of him promising a penthouse to Putin. (Bitch please)
B) Mueller is squeezing Cohen for everything he is worth and inducing false confessions to try and drum up more hysteria/charges in exchange for leniency. (Very likely given what we know about Cohen situation)

4. GEOTUS would compromise his entire presidency and essentially let Putin pull all the strings in the executive branch as Putin would have information that could devastate the presidency. (All this for 13 Russian Facebook posters? What other tangible evidence is there of anything? (None of this salacious and unverifiable garbage))

I could go on and on with this but I’ve got a life

TL;DR - Cohens word is worth jack shit and FBI had had his files for months. GEOTUS wouldn’t turn in information that would perjure himself knowing that Cohen could have incriminating information on him. GEOTUS wouldn’t compromise his presidency for some magical benefit the Russians provided GEOTUS to steal Hillary Clinton’s rightfully earned presidential victory.

Keln78,"I know precisely what it means. Ideology is to personal beliefs as organized religion is to personal religious beliefs. Ideology is prescribed.

*i·de·ol·o·gy*
*/ˌīdēˈäləjē,ˌidēˈäləjē/*
*noun*
*noun: ideology; plural noun: ideologies*

   *1.    a system of ideas and ideals, especially one that forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy.*

Key word there buck-o is ""system"". 

Our President is not ideological, he is pragmatic. He is patriotic. He lets his instincts guide him, not some checklist of things that Ben Shapiro made.

Do you so easily forget the primary complaint of the NeverTrump jackasses? That he, and his supporters, are not Conservative enough? Conservative has become an ideology to these people and they are slaves to it. We just want our country to be great again, so we are free to use any means to do so. ""True"" conservatives balk at using tariffs, as an example, to win at trade. Because the ideology says ""tariffs bad"". Just like Leftist ideology says ""orange man bad"". Ideology is programming.

MCScottyB,"Ford declined bailout money not because they were so smart or better than GM or Chrysler. Ford was the first of the Big 3 to nearly go bankrupt (about a year or so before the economic collapse). They secured a special line of credit brokered by Goldman Sachs to restructure. Mortgaged the company to the hilt including the Blue Oval trademark. When the economy collapsed and credit was frozen, GM was unable to secure a line of credit to restructure due to the freeze. Ford didn’t need bailout funds because they already secured a line of credit through their fortune of good  timing by being the first of the Big 3 to almost die. That’s the real story from someone (me) who has worked in this business all of my adult life. For the record, the commies in the Obama administration handled the bailout horribly, favoring unions over bond holders.
     As a person on the right, it drives me nuts with all the “muh Ford didn’t need a bailout” from folks who have ZERO clue about this industry. Read “Car Guys Vs. Bean Counters” by Bob Lutz, a former USMC fighter pilot and GM senior executive. Once you read it and see how the Democrat controlled Congress virtually destroyed the US auto industry through arbitrary CAFE nonsense in the 70’s (which led to poor product offerings by the Big 3 in the 80’s and turned many Americans against domestics and toward Japanese cars, you will likely be singing a different tune. The year of the bankruptcy, GM was #1 in JD Power’s initial quality survey, knocking out Lexus, who held it 10 years in a row. GM got out of the healthcare business and made the UAW pay their own way through a VEBA trust. They became #1 in the largest car market (China), all BEFORE the economic collapse and bankruptcy. They were doing everything right and the clock ran out. It was not GM’s fault as the then largest provider of healthcare outside the US Govt that the lack of a sensible healthcare policy or reform caused GM to spend over $1200 per car assembled on healthcare. It was not GM’s fault that the US’s lack of an energy policy (thankfully we drill more now) led to $5 gas and cratered SUV sales. Also not GM’s fault the government allowed Wall Street banks to run wild and crash the economy (thank you Dem Chris Dodd and Fannie and the lot). 
    GM dealers could not get floor plan financing due to the credit freeze. Banks stopped lending for new car purchases. Most companies can handle headwinds, but these three all at once were a killer. So please, get educated about GM. Yes, they got an $11b bailout from the taxpayers. However my fellow Pedes, the Fed gifted our banks who created the mess $85b of OUR money every month during the last 6 years of the Obama administration and I don’t hear any “muh, Quantitative Easing!” from you all. QE was a rolling monthly bailout of the banks that WE are stuck with and have to pay for and blew up the debt on Obama’s watch. That’s over $1Trillion a year in bank bailouts ON TOP of the $800billion bank bailout by the Congress but “muh, GM bad bc Ford didn’t need a bailout and Mary Barra GM CEO is a democrat.” 
   Many of the plants GM (a global company) built overseas were due to excessive regulations (thanks dems) here in the US made US operations cost prohibitive. And, the plants they are closing are building cars that have fallen out of the favored tastes of consumers. Should GM keep building cars out of Oshawa Ontario (Canada) or Hamtramck Michigan that not enough people want to buy because reasons and government dictates? That’s the antithesis of capitalism.  It’s too easy to make GM the whipping boy. The banks and the Fed are the obvious deserving targets but that would require deeper thinking. Just like the NPC’s saying “Orange Man Bad” there are many on TD acting the same way “GM bad” without the depth of background  on this subject. Downvote to hell all you want. I do not care. Like our government, GM cannot, nor ever will be, all things to all people or be above or beneath criticism. The painful moves they are making are right ones to shore up for the future. Let’s  hope they find another product line to build at Lordstown in Ohio so we can keep that crown jewel of US manufacturing up and running.

The list he used for the ""Muslim Ban"" was based on Obama's list.

Number to tax cuts everybody profited from this I know I sure did more money means more spending into the economy

More money into the economy means a higher GDP which means that eventually the deficit will start going down

Low unemployment numbers including record low most African Americans and Latino Americans.

The beating up of our military which scares even Europe America is no longer a laughing stock nor we considered soft we were never really were considered soft but since George w Bush was in office and then replaced by Obama our military hasn't been looked at around our own government and across the world but they forget we're America and we don't need to be fucked with by them and won't be.

independentbystander,"\&gt; how do we bring more ppl into the fold ?



I have no idea. In my case, ""cutting the cord"" was a big life upgrade because I wasn't getting the 24-7 indoctrination from MSM. Most movies/TV shows are basically advertisements for bad behavior and Leftist Narrative. (I have been Red-pilled for many years, but getting the MSM influence out of my house was still very helpful.) 



Unfortunately, social media/cellphone addiction has taken the place of TV obsession. Our populace is **never** going to let go of Digital Crack. They are far too hooked on narcissism to imagine an existence without being facedown in their everpresent cellphone. If the cellphone network went down permanently those people would still be poking at the blank screen, gazing longingly at their reflection with fond memories of the selfies that they pray will someday return. 



Worse yet, those social-media-obsessed people are getting a constant stream of false propaganda along with their narcissism. Be that from their facebook friends or MSM Narrative-Pushers, the peer pressure to jump on the ""*Orange Man Bad! reeeeeeee*"" bandwagon is very persuasive to normies who place a high priority on conformity in the interest of gaining more attention for their selfies. 



As long as sensible people are ridiculed for daring to disagree with The Narrative, and MSM continues to make an example of any Traditional American they can manufacture a news cycle about by blowing a story totally out of proportion in ludicrous over-reaction pandering to SJW outrage, I have no idea how to Red-pill the Highly Indoctrinated. 



The momentum of several decades of ""progressive"" programming is difficult if not impossible to reverse. People raised on Cultural Marxism experience extreme cognitive dissonance when confronted with common sense and American Tradition. They have been indoctrinated to glorify mediocrity while treating intelligence and experience with disdain, and have been taught an Orwellian version of history that caters to Leftist ideology. 



I have struggled with this for decades. Attempting to reason with heavily-indoctrinated people generally doesn't go well, as neither extreme of Left-nor-Right people respond well to common sense/facts/logic/statistics that don't line up with their programming. It seems that people on-the-fence are much more open to the Red-Pill, as these are analytical types who do not readily embrace groupthink.

kmebn,"&gt; Valuing 'complexity' to the exclusion of other artistic virtues is a hallmark of post-modern thought.  

If you think that post-modern art is more complex than modernist and pre-modern art, then I encourage you to consume more of all of the above.  I personally find modernist and pre-modern art to be wonderfully complex.  I 100% agree with you that trying to be ""complex for the sake of complex"" is super tedious, though.  


&gt; Where is the 'complexity' of Michelangelo's 'Pieta,' 

I would say that the complexity of all Pietà scenes is the tension between wanting to mourn the loss while realizing that there is a greater victory present.  

&gt; or of Brahms' Requiem 

I would say that the complexity of all requiems is, again the tension between mourning the loss and celebrating the greater victory involved.  

&gt; Beauty, craftsmanship and aesthetics all exist 

I 100% agree with you, and I really don't find any in ""The Lion King"".  People are free to disagree.  Beauty is subjective.  Someone can probably make a very compelling argument that the animation itself shows admirable craftsmanship, which is fine, but I would still find the plot and characters super-tedious.  

&gt; Material for children especially should be engaged in construction of morals, not deconstruction. 

I hear what you are saying, but I would say that teaching children to question and explore is more developmentally appropriate than presenting them with absolutes.  We, as a culture, are now in the state we are, in large part due to a generation coming of age unable to fathom that the orange man who the authorities have told them is absolutely bad might not really be absolutely bad.

hello_japan,"Obama didn’t just separate children, he actually [placed children with human traffickers](http://archive.is/qr0Jf) 

“The Obama administration failed to protect thousands of Central American children who have flooded across the U.S. border since 2011, leaving them vulnerable to traffickers and to abuses at the hands of government-approved caretakers, a Senate investigation has found.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, failed to do proper background checks of adults who claimed the children, allowed sponsors to take custody of multiple unrelated children, and regularly placed children in homes without visiting the locations, according to a 56-page investigative report released Thursday.

And once the children left federally funded shelters, the report said, the agency permitted their adult sponsors to prevent caseworkers from providing them post-release services.

Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) initiated the six-month investigation after several Guatemalan teens were found in a dilapidated trailer park near Marion, Ohio, where they were being held captive by traffickers and forced to work at a local egg farm. The boys were among more than 125,000 unaccompanied minors who have surged into the United States since 2011, fleeing violence and unrest in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.”

““It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” Portman said in a written statement. “What makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.”

“The report was released ahead of a hearing Thursday before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which Portman co-chairs with Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). It detailed nearly 30 cases where unaccompanied children had been trafficked after federal officials released them to sponsors or where there were “serious trafficking indicators.”

“HHS places children with individuals about whom it knows relatively little and without verifying the limited information provided by sponsors about their alleged relationship with the child,” the report said.
For example, one Guatemalan boy planned to live with his uncle in Virginia. But when the uncle refused to take the boy, he ended up with another sponsor, who forced him to work nearly 12 hours a day to repay a $6,500 smuggling debt, which the sponsor later increased to $10,900, the report said.

A boy from El Salvador was released to his father even though he told a caseworker that his father had a history of beating him, including hitting him with an electrical cord. In September, the boy alerted authorities that his father was forcing him to work for little or no pay, the report said; a post-release service worker later found the boy was being kept in a basement and given little food.

The Senate investigation began in July after federal prosecutors indicted six people in connection with the Marion labor-trafficking scheme, which involved at least eight minors and two adults from the Huehuetenango region of Guatemala.

One defendant, Aroldo Castillo-Serrano, 33, used associates to file false applications with the government agency tasked with caring for the children, and bring them to Ohio, where he kept them in squalid conditions in a trailer park and forced them to work 12-hour days, at least six days a week, for little pay. Castillo-Serrano has pleaded guilty to labor-trafficking charges and awaits sentencing in the Northern District of Ohio in Toledo.”

RoninIV,"VA Pede here.  Let me break down fake news for you. 

1. The Regional Offices (RO) do not process the GI Bill.  That is done via the central educational benefits offices in Muskogee, OK, and that office must work directly with the schools receiving the funds.  It's a complex system, but again, the whole VA Benefits Administration (VBA) does not do work on the GI Bill.  This particular goof looks like a computer systems error.

2. Mandatory Overtime.  Urg...where do I start on this one?  We at the VBA have been under mandatory overtime for the last seven years. This year has seen MONTHS of solid mando OT with no break in sight.  Now, don't get me wrong. I actually truly enjoy my job (I really do) and don't mind putting in another 10 or so hours per week.  What I want to address is the thrust of this fake news article linking the GI Bill goof up with VBA overtime and the OT being cancelled.

So, to reiterate, the two departments VBA and VA Ed) have nothing to do with each other.  Likewise, the overtime cancellation has nothing to do with the GI Bill.  At the VBA, we have small reprieve every year --at the same time of year--on mando OT.  Why? Guess what this week is?  That's right. Thanksgiving.  Everyone takes a day or two off to go be with family.  There just will not be many people around to come in at night or the weekends.

Next month?  Yup. Christmas and New Years.  Same thing.  It is the one time of year we can safely say that most people will be on vacation and will not be there for OT.
 
We can also safely say that after New Years...BOOM!  Mandatory overtime will be back on the menu.  Happens every year.

This article is trying to mix causation and correlation with an audience who knows nothing about the inner workings of a huge department in the hopes that there will be a loud cry of ""Orange Man Bad"" from their readers.

I hope that makes sense.",2018-11-20,1,The_Donald

Thanks.  It sounded like you had no idea what you were talking about in all your pompous delirium, and now you removed all doubt.

Check this out- here's the full write up and it basically answers for the whole gap we brought up together.  [https://civilrights.org/vote-no-first-step-act-2/](https://civilrights.org/vote-no-first-step-act-2/)

If you read it, you'll notice 2 things: 

1. that our congress is gripping tight onto the same kind of rhetoric, accusations, conjecture, fear mongering, and divisive language that you'd expect from a leftist facebook page or r-politics.  Laughable and look at all the signers- this is the sort of fuel our congress runs on today.

2. that our congress largely voted for this bill, not against it, because (*shocker*) it's good!!  Meaning all but 57 dems looked at this letter I've linked and said nah that's stupid, it's a good bill.

They even answered for my final point:

&gt;Finally, if presented with one choice, “to take what we can get now,” then we must ensure that “what we get” will not perpetuate the existing harms of mass incarceration or give false hope to the men and women languishing in prison and the communities we represent. Our communities are being demonized and criminalized so we must stand firm to resist the lure of a compromise that is ultimately a false promise that may never be realized and isn’t in their best interests.

The statistics are like 10 dead Russians for 1 Finn. And the Finns had less men, worse equipment, less of everything. 

And Finland actually is very pro-Finland, with a proud Finnish nationalist mentality. They do 2years mandatory military service. People who take a military ‘desk job’ to avoid it get looked down on and even lose jobs because of it.

If one crazy Finn was chatting orange man bad, believe me there are five more who are fed up of immigration, EU law, the fact that Finland pays more into the EU than it takes out and all the rest of it.

It’s not a surrender monkey, stuck up nation like France. It’s a ready to fight military nation that will take your chubby US naked body into a Sauna, (Finland has more Saunas than people lol) make you sweat like fuck, whilst feeling insecure about your man tits... then they will call you a bitch if you don’t jump into an icy lake straight after it. Followed by drinking over a litre of vodka.

Its a nation Russia cant even fuck with, with only 5million ppl. They also create some of the most brilliant technological solutions to problems. And they don’t show emotions in public (unless drinking). So if you go there smiling shouting HEY WHATS UP GUYS HOW ARE YOU they will say ‘fine’ without smiling and move away from you.

see thats where you are wrong. 

they actually arent concerned about it nor do they care about the actual issue. its simply an ice breaker into a shared outrage session which is their real desire.

they dont want you to talk about facts and issues with them they simply want to ""Orange man bad"" with you for a while.

The ""issue of the day"" is simply the vehicle to that end. these people simply need an outlet for the pent up frustration or a place to repeat snappy twitter insults they saw on their phone and pass them off as their own material. its why the NPC meme hit so hard, being empty unoriginal shells of people is their dark secret. forcing them to discus the facts or have a real opinion  makes them panic and look for ways to get out or flip the subject to a comfort zone.

Cruz is Hispanic.  But he's male.  And he's part of the power structure.  And he doesn't vote lockstep for the approved people.  And he's Republican.

The SJW types use one characteristic as a shorthand (women), or a small handful when they feel it necessary (black gay genderfluid)...

But the reality is the whole calculus in the background... The INTERSECTION of all the factors and identity variables, to give you your social credit score.

It's how a white male ""feminist"" avoids being a ""fucking white male;"" yes, they are saddled with the intersection of white and male, but they've added feminist to the calculus.  Add orange Man bad, support for socialism, and activism for illegal aliens, and your intersection can be totally ""repaired"" from your initial handicap!

It's fantastic.  It's a way to slice up society into incredibly fine bits fighting with each other whilst giving the people who tow the party line a pass on their own absolutist ideology... At least as long as the people in charge do the math and don't just fall into the short form ideology.

They know the law suit is gunna fail, but while it's happening they will hype it up like it's a sure thing to their base.  When it does get dismissed(like it should) the Dems and MSM will spin it like Trump and his judges are authoritarian figures that hate the freedom of the press.  Next come the low key calls for violence from CNN and top Dems and probably a protest/riot or two for good measure(funded by Soros of course).  They will probably make a reference  to Hitler or Fascism.  Antifa will probably do some shit.  And finally they will reference this whole fiasco until 2020 as an example of Trump being ""against the free press"" and just another reason why orange man bad.  

Dems are at the point where they are strategically setting themselves up to lose against GEOTUS purely to be able to shit on him and rile up their base.  Which is hilarious.  It's like Dr. Ford/Kavanaugh situation but they already know they ain't gunna win.

SyNiKaLiTy,"I just got through this shit yesterday in /r/pics while they were all dick riding each other about ""orange man canceled WW1 event.."" while i merely pointed out there was actual election fraud going on. No matter WHAT I did; providing 'evidence' (all of which they rejected/outright refused to read), slandering me, calling me worthless, a racist, un-educated, a 'piece of shit', trash, (etc), continued to bring up the 'validity of the Mueller investigation (and when I asked what evidence they had they reverted back to slander and name calling), they proceeded to do almost EVERYTHING they try to say their against.   


I'm ashamed to be classified as a human, the same way they are. These are literally the worst of the worst, most despicable, degenerative, bigoted, racist people on the planet. They literally make me wish the worst things in life that could happen, DO happen to them as a result of how they treat other people with a mere difference in opinion. That's it! Nothing more than a different view point.  


It makes me angry that they are the way they are, and having a real life friend get sucked in to the mob with the move [on.org](https://on.org) protests last week and refusing all contact with me, I... I just don't know what do do against these kinds of people, and makes ME fear for THEIR lives should they attack me. I just get this sinking feeling that if I EVER get attacked by someone like this, that I'll probably go into  self preservation/survival mode (as I've been 'trained' to do), quite possibly lose myself in it, and (when the dust settles) there will be a VERY high probability be the lifeless bodies of my 'attackers'.

albirdly,"&gt; Do you guys HONESTLY believe that human beings who are American citizens are more or less likely to commit violent crimes? Because you can't just take every time an illegal alien commits crime and say BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS. 

That's exactly what I think. People who are already ""American citizens"" are already here because they were born here - there is nothing we can do about them. There IS however something we can do about the scum sneaking across the border, from cultures that place a very low value on human life compared to the West. 

Your pitiful argument is what's called a ""non-sequitur"" Mister Rational. 

I'm glad Obama deported tons of scumbags - but suddenly if Trump wants to enforce the law he becomes Orange Man Bad racist nazi.

Calling it now. Whitaker is lowkey pro-marijuana, Trump is gonna push to deregulate it at the federal level and leave it up to the states like he wanted, neverTrump republicans have no dear leader anymore to lead a crusade, and Pelosi's dems will have to choose between Orange Man Bad™ and Common Sense™ marijuana reform - a rock and a hard place, a monster of their own making. You'll see MSM performing gold medal gymnastics trying to justify opposing weed, and more and more centrists feeling alienated by the reeeeing crescendo in the Democratic Party as SJWs gain power and establishment dems lose control of the leash. Oh, dear, what ever will the Green Party back? Weed, of course, and they're going to get a chunk of the more reasonable dems as a way of compromising their conflicted feels. If MSM keep antagonizing alt media and SJWs keep doubling down on insanity it could be decades before the dems are taken seriously again.

Not at all.  I am not accusing anyone of anything.  The video speaks for itself.  There was a physical altercation between Acosta and the Intern that was initiated by Acosta.  This is a plain viewing of the video.  CNN and Acosta later said it never happened.

&gt;You're saying the others are bringing up the fact that the video has been tampered with to hide the shoving the arm away thing

Never said this.  Said they are changing the narrative to Orange Man Bad from Acosta's Physical Altercation with Intern.  Oh, and yea, they are denying that it even happened.

&gt;but now you might be saying ignore the tampered video thing because the arm shoving thing happened first.

We hate Trump. Orange Man Bad"" mandate. Their only platform really has been to hate Trump. Now they've got a platform to impede him. So I'm worried. Because they're still just clinging to the 'Trump is Bad' mandate. My concerns are that Trump won't be able to reason with them. If they lose their ""Trump bad"" image, they've lose the only mandate they've had. So I predict they'll just obstruct, block and screech for investigations. If they don't, what else do they have?

IncredibleMrE1,"Considering that:

1) The incumbent party loses during the midterm cycle

2) The Democrats were going to have a BLUE WAVE that would be a massive referendum against Bad Orange Man

I'd say growing the margin in the Senate to likely 55-45 (!!!!!) and losing the House by less than 10 votes isn't all that bad.

It’s a new day in America.

God is in his glory and loves this country enough to guide it through thick and thin and yesterday was another example of that.

As I predicted (almost) the Republicans picked up Senate seats and lost House seats. The almost part comes because I thought the R’s would lose 15 or 20 House seats and just barely hold on – and instead, they lost 35 and did not hold on.

But this outcome, upon refection, pleases me.

As usual, the American people -- are smarter than me.

My new view:

This will be a good check on Trump.

This will ALSO give Trump a foil, a negotiating platform with an adversary he knows -- and simultaneously make the Democrats accountable to the American people and to the newly empowered progressive minority within their party.

Most importantly, this will pacify tens of millions of Americans that were going crazy with TDS because they were completely out of power.

Paradoxically for Dems, this outcome also legitimizes Trump.

He’s been in power now for 2 years and the public GAVE him additional power in the Senate. This was not an accident. If the American people thought Trump was a danger to the country, a crazy, Orange Man Bad – they would not have cemented his power base in the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi knows this, that her victory was razor thin, all of which gives her no legitimate impeachment argument.

Impeachment in the end is political. Although in this case, there is also, now after 2 years, no evidence of Trump wrong doing whatsoever.

Pelosi knew all this, all along.

She just couldn’t negotiate without any power.

That’s out of the way now, the American people have spoken and both Trump and Pelosi will listen and start to do deals.

It’s what they both live for.

It's almost mind boggling that the media and celebrities have convinced people to vote against the interest of their families by stopping the steam of the economy (and Metro Detroits economy is killing it right now!) in order to aspire to the sexist idea of ""making the future female"" (imagine if it was make the future male, REEEE!).

Another lie of the Democrats was that Republicans dont support insurance for pre existing ideas.  As we saw Trump trying to pass through health care legislation that double the pool of 8 billion to 16 billion for that very reason (thanks for blowing that McCain).

I asked her one day “ mom, when was the last time you read anything positive about Trump in the news?” 

She said she didn’t even know. Literally couldn’t even think of a positive story. 

So I asked her “isn’t that weird mom? I mean, he’s out POTUS, unemployment is at historical lows, consumer confidence is a historical highs, the stock market is sky rocketing, and manufacturing is roaring back, but the news has nothing good to report? Does that make any sense?” 

She agreed it did seem odd, but then she said she didn’t like the way he spoke to people. That he sounded like a bully and didn’t appreciate his tone. I said “would you have a great tone if literally everything said about you by 95% of the media was mean spirited, negative, and aggressive. she said “probably not”

Then I asked her if she ever actually listened to one of his rally speeches, unedited. Not the sound bites from the news, but an actual rally from start to finish. So she could actually hear his words in the context they are spoken. She said no. 

I then challenged her to go and watch one of his speeches without editing and tell me again that she thinks “Orange Man Bad” 

That was a couple days ago. 

I am waiting to hear what she has to say about him after she watches a rally speech.

AyyyyyyyyyyyyySuckIt,"They can't. Most music is licensed through ASCAP, BMI and SESAC, a couple of acronyms you've likely noticed at least once on a record or CD sleeve. These organizations provide licensing for (almost) every recorded song to be used for public performance. Anywhere that you go where music is played - bars, clubs, event venues, airports, etc are subject to paying for these licenses. The license fee is determined by the capacity of the venue, the types of performances featured, and the number of display devices (such as televisions and projectors) present in the venue. Even mobile DJ's such as you might see at a wedding or bar mitzvah pay these fees, which ensure the artists and all the other people involved in the process of producing and recording the music get paid for the performance use of their product.

The Leftist/Democrat base is extremely motivated by their Narrative/Political Correctness ""Orange Man Bad! *reeeee* F*ck Douroubpfh"" babble-chant mantra. They will possibly find more ""unity"" in whatever New Propaganda Canard that is likely to pop up between now and Tuesday, be that a new ""hate crime"" hoax, a viral video, or another ""anonymous source""-based whopper from MSM.   



Another concern is the illegal alien vote, along with other voter fraud shenanigans in states with weak Voter Identification policies. I predict to again see the typical fishy results from those areas who report more votes counted than the number of registered voters.  



My hope is that we will have another big turnout due to the ""Monster Vote"" that made such a difference in 2016. The MSM pollsters got a wedgie due to ignoring the Conservative part of the population who were less likely to trust pollsters thus did not give their information as freely as the Leftists who feel entitled to go full-blast with their opinions at all times.

Serious question: why are so many people becoming victims to propaganda? You’d think that they would be on the look out for it with them knowing absolutely everything about the Holocaust (lol). 

I think these people are trying to find meaning in their lives. Many are wandering with no real direction in life. Out of the blue, they are told that orange man is bad and racist, and that only *they* can put a stop to it. I believe most of them genuinely want to better the world, but they are indoctrinated to believe that orange man is bad and racist and is ruining the country. 

So, they desperately want meaning in life, and they desperately want a crowd to fit in to. Because of this, they become vulnerable to propaganda, and become indoctrinated by it.

Now, what is the solution? I believe speaking in a civilized way with those who are willing to listen (pointless to talk to some who are intolerant of anything you have to say) is the only solution. ",2018-11-02,1,The_Donald

When challenged by the moderators (fuckin A by the way, good on an honest media for once), she claims ignorance.

So...i'm to deduce that A) she AND HER STAFF don't know meaning they are  incompetent and mis-managed. Think what you wish about her boss in this scenario.

theInteriorDesigner,"Short/long story, It all went down on Facebook

One of my old female liberal friends from HS (I'll call her NPC1) went on a tirade about the synagogue shooting and how Trump said that if they had a gun they might have had a better outcome. ""Does he expect every place of worship to be armed? ""She went on to say that she wanted to hear from Trump supporters who agreed. After a few hours of nobody responding to her I stepped up to the plate. I'm sick of tired of nobody challenging these people. 

my post:
Ya know (NPC1), I don't usually 'debate' people about politics on the internet, because its usually a lost cause. I'm not going to change your mind, and you wont change mine.  I fully support TRUMP 1000 percent. Proud red hat wearing deplorable. 

But for the last two years I have sat by and watched people I grew up with bash ""my side"" non stop with ineffective rhetoric. Awesome, you are allowed your opinion, fantastic go for it. Shout it from the tops of buildings for all I care, I sit back and watch quietly. The TDS is pretty rampant in Massachusetts - shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. 

Oh look, some psycho does something awful, lets blame a whole group of people who has NOTHING to do with it. I get it, its easy to say ""Orange man bad"" and get applause from an echo chamber. Where were you in 2017  Scalise was shot by at Congressional baseball game?  That massacre was stopped also when a good guy with a gun (actually a woman and a man with a gun) shot back. So yes, I would rather know that someone near me has a CCL where ever I am. I would rather know that there is someone willing to fight back and not be a sitting duck for someone. Do you know ANYONE with a CCL? 

But go ahead and claim we are all wrong because you know better for all of us. Don't be so shocked this time when he is reelected  in 2020.""

Mentioned to another person to watch Walkway videos if you think 'our side' is trying to divide the nation. 
Then another old female friend from HS (she can be NPC2)  (mind you I graduated in 97, we're all adults now) responded to my comments saying ""you sound to me like a self hating woman"" 

I thanked her for that and said I would think of her while I voted. 

And get this, NPC1 actually defended me to NPC2!  

 I quote ""As much as I wonder how Trump fans cannot see the divisiveness he emulates, I also cannot understand how so many anti-Trump folks can't see how polarizing they are. What purpose is served by belittling (TheInteriorDesigner)? 
I think we all have to recognize that we are all human and being influenced by the world in different ways. If we can do that, then we can have conversations.""

Just because some lunatics think Jews control the world does not mean regular Americans don't have a right to cherish and defend their freedoms and sovergnty.  The left is constantly fomenting hate and division over the weakest arguments.  It is insanely ignorant.  Antisemitism is actually more common in left wing circles, sometimes flying under the banner of antizionism.

All most of us are doing is sharing ideas, voting, and having a laugh here or there.  Trumps party is pro zionist, obviously, and is even criticized by the left for how pro zionist it is.  To criticize how pro zionist it is while also calling it antisemitic is completely insane.

I was shocked to see the news showing these people being carried past cameras covered in blood.

Comments from people giving phone numbers you could call to see if your loved ones were alright. Comments with info on locations you could go to donate blood. Comments on the streets that were blocked off to avoid so emergency response crews could do their jobs. Comments describing the shooter and his stated motives/background. All of it was deleted as fast as it was posted. Facts were banned. 

I came to this sub to get updates, this was one of the only places on the entire site that wasn't censoring anything. We gathered here and cried for the innocent LGBT people just trying to have a fun night out dancing that ended up getting slaughtered. 

Nevermind, the aftermath. Even when the hostage negotiation call transcripts were released with the shooter saying ""I DID IT BECAUSE I'M MUSLIM AND YOUR GOV'T IS KILLING MY PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, SO I'M KILLING YOUR PEOPLE HERE"", we weren't allowed to mention that on other subs in case anyone got upset that Obama's droning hobby and bombings of civilians directly influenced the shooter.

\&gt; Sorry, what are you even talking about here? Deep state? The FBI is helping them?

\[Read the news once every few months.\]([http://thefederalist.com/2018/07/23/10-key-takeaways-released-fisa-warrants-carter-page/](http://thefederalist.com/2018/07/23/10-key-takeaways-released-fisa-warrants-carter-page/))

\&gt; ""Forget about the fact that they (who's they?!) deliberately tried to strip us of our franchise"" What fucking franchise? What are you even talking about here?

&amp;#x200B;

Are you a paid foreign schill or something? Franchise. Suffrage. Right to vote. Brush up on your English. How can you even read the constitution if you don't know something as basic as this?

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; (rambling confusion about the vote)

&amp;#x200B;

You don't seem to have any awareness of what the Russia/FISA/FBI/DOJ scandal actually is, and there is far too much for me to type here. Basically, Obama's justice department (FBI/DoJ) used the Democrat-funded Steele Dossier (who was paid by the FBI) to lie to a FISA court in order to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. After he won anyway, they used plants and various tactics to cover up for themselves and try to pin some kind of collusion charge in hopes of removing him from office, thus negating the election and our vote.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; I don't know? MAYBE SAVING PEOPLES LIVES!?

&amp;#x200B;

That's their job. It is also their job enforce our laws equally and perform their duties responsibly. Lying to a FISA court, lying to Congress, and entrapping US citizens is an abdication of their duties. If you only do a fraction of your job, do you get fired? If a fire department only sends out a fraction of their crew to put out a fire, is that good enough? If the brakes fail on your car, but the steering still works perfectly, are you still satisfied? No? Then stop making stupid assertions like ""b-b-but some of them save lives"". I've got news for you. If you rob a bank, kill someone, or simply fail to pay your taxes on time, guess what? You're going to jail and it doesn't matter if you have a goddamn nobel prize. That's how the law works you moron.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; What if... and this may be way out in left field for you, but what if the FBI, CIA and courts where doing their fucking job so there was never a need to blow a whistle?

&amp;#x200B;

Go over the link I posted above. It is a proven fact that they illegally misrepresented evidence in a FISA court, lied under oath to congress, and more. There was a great need for a whistleblower, but everyone on the case was thoroughly corrupt including the Directors. This is important, because the Director is the last line of defense against abuse of the FISA court. You may want to read up on what the FISA court is, how it differs from a regular court, and why it matters.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; B-b-but Trump's friends broke the law too.

&amp;#x200B;

1) This does not excuse any crimes committed by people you like, or people who are working against people you don't like (in this case FBI/DoJ against Trump).

&amp;#x200B;

2) Sure, they got Manafort on being a tax cheat...back in 2014 and the years leading up to it, long before Trump ever decided to run. They got Flynn for...not accurately detailing a report to Pence? BTW it's looking like he's going to be let go on account of Mueller withholding exculpatory evidence. Has ""MUH RUSSIA"" produced a single relevant charge after two years of investigation? Of course not. It is a smoke screen for the FISA scandal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every week we find out that the investigators are Hillary supporters, or Loretta Lynch gave Veselnitskaya a special parole to stay in the US (and that it was expired by the time she went to Trump Tower), or that Christopher Steele was paid by the FBI even though they claimed they didn't know him.

Q1776,"They tried to do this this morning on a local public radio talk show. I called in and set them straight.  Called them out for not mentioning this is all in context of attacks on the the “other side” (from their POV). Such as Ricin/powder envelopes. And attacks in the coastal cities by masked and booted thugs with homemade weapons. 
I also mentioned I felt I didn’t see enough unity messaging and denouncing of attacks against the right by the Democrat party leadership to expect a similar response from the right.

(I, of course, had to play wolf in sheep’s clothing in order convey my message in a way that wouldn’t immediately be dismissed as a “Trump defender”.)

It worked exceptionally well. And the host and interviewer immediately shifted tactics into a message that pinpointed their exact issue with things. “Well we aren’t seeing Trump come out and give us all the feels goods” is basically how it went down. 

Which is amazing progress when it comes to public radio. I was able to stop them from echo chamber Trump Bashing and get them to directly state what was bothering THEM about how he handled things. 

They stopped using buzzwords and were specific. Something the left needs to improve upon. Less “Orange Man Bad”.

Mawrak,"It shows that the account is verified. Basically it shows that the user behind the account is really who they claim to be. The thing is, verified accounts get their response upper in the chain, and they are less likely to have their comments be removed from the visible chain (did I mention twitter's response system is an abysmal clusterfuck?) and therefore they can be seen by more people. That's why when you open Trump's tweet and look at the responses, chances are, you will see a hundred blue checked accounts spewing NPC talking points, and you have to scroll down before you get to the good stuff. Look at any Trump tweet, and you will see them for sure, and 99% of these accounts are extreme hard left ""orange man bad"" kind of accounts. No individual thoughts whatsoever, they are like a hive mind.

For whatever reason, there are significantly more blue checked liberal accounts than there are conservative\pro-Trump.

You know what I think about this whole debacle? Somebody is funding/organizing/pushing this horde of people. Let's see how much they want to risk people getting killed. I would be pleasantly surprised if they back down once the rubber meets the road, but not *too* surprised. Then if they don't back off, let's see how many of these ""migrants"" want to risk walking face first into the muzzles of the most powerful military on the planet. A military that has been balls deep in the longest insurgencies in recent history, full of troops experienced in dealing with asymmetric conflict. Good fucking luck.

This is totally a political maneuver for the midterms. They want, some people get hurt or killed in hopes that it pisses off the lefties enough to get out and vote. That's their game here. The worst case scenario is Trump backs down and the right voting base doesn't go out to vote. Knowing the president, and the fact that this is completely against the face of one of his strongest stances, I don't see that happening.

People are going to show up to the border in droves. The border patrol, the National Guard, and active duty elements are going to repel them. People are going to get their feelings hurt, probably get tear gassed and roughed up in some situations... and it's going to fire up the right side voting base to see someone finally having enough balls not to let us get shit on by whatever bunch of dicks feels like it. The lefties are going to play it up ""orange man bad"", ""orange man hates migrants"" to try and fire up enough of their people to save the midterms. When it's all said and done, their little attempt at a rebound is going to fall flat and either the House and Senate will hold the numbers they have now, or the Republicans will gain.

You can screencap that last paragraph. I'm telling you, that's how this shit is going to go down from here until the end of the year/elections.

I really feel like clandestine leftist groups started this to try and put Trump and the Republicans between a rock and a hard place after the Kavanaugh debacle blew up in their faces. There is no fucking way a bunch of people in the third world are going to magically organize, decide they're going to bum rush a country ran by the one motherfucker that is going to tell them to kick rocks, and then magically get let into other countries and magically receive aid and transportation. I don't think the organizers of this anticipate how much the right is going to get pumped up to vote seeing the president preventing these people from walking in.

I sincerely hope we get to the bottom of this,  and I hope they drill who ever is responsible.

Basically what is happening is hay Bartolo Fuentes (ex Honduran lawmaker) started with just 200 people and told them he’d lead them to the US to a better life. Well, it spiraled out of control because one of the original 200 began the rumor that Bartolo was going to pay the costs for everyone’s travel. Their whole premise is to basically make a point about how bad things are in Honduras but we now see that, coupled with a rumor of a free-pass all these other countries and their shitty problems have attached themselves to this group. 

Maybe an oversimplification but it’s certainly not China nor the Catholic Church nor really any other group who wants the Orange Man to suffer, lol. https://nypost.com/2018/10/23/meet-the-man-behind-the-migrant-caravan-headed-to-us/",2018-10-24,6,The_Donald

The last thing he needs is the ""dead kid on the beach picture"" that the garbage MSM would use a cudgel to bludgeon him over the head with.

Unfortunately a lot of people in this country have been so insulated from outside dangers they have gone soft mentally and physically. 

The actions of our past generations to insulate us and protect us from foreign threats has allowed us to create a fictional thought bubble, where people believe everyone thinks and holds the same values we do. SPoiler alert they do not.

9/11 was a wakeup call, but sadly with the mismanagement of Afghanistan and Iraq many people went back to sleep and allowed the MSM to paint the US as the perpetrator rather than the victim of 9/11. This bullshit has allowed people to label you islamophobic or racist if you criticize anything about that garbage religion. This has now transitioned with the help of the Democrats to be if you oppose anyone with melanin in their skin your a NAZI, RACIST, BIGOT, FASCIST who needs to die already!

https://imgur.com/gallery/YF3yhz1


Beyond the $250 stroller, the kid has spotless shoes, and spotless clothes. Have you been around kids?  Can you see a child that age with zero wear on the knees?... particularly after they’ve “walked many hundreds of miles”?  It looks like the parent stopped by BabyGAP in Honduras just before the photo shoot was done. 

This is a manufactured event. This is for cameras, this is for the election. Somehow these people will magically appear on America’s doorstep right before election day.  Just like 4000 people just “magically” decided to simultaneously start a long journey complete with embedded reporters ending at our southern boarder moments prior to an election. 

It’s an invasion, but an invasion of poor foreign mercenaries, paid for and/or taken advantage of by the left purely for the purposes of optics before an election. 

It's not asylum, as they’ve forfeited that by not applying to the country where they landed, so when they invade (likely in a riotous frenzy), it will be illegally, and a giant cluster fuck when Trump stops them.  

And oh the cameras will be rolling to capture the outrage and the misery, the wails of the very few women and children actually in the group, to capture the horror stories of their treatment, and to blame ""the bad orange man"" right as election day rolls around. 

SOME, perhaps many, of these people are “real”, no doubt tricked or bribed (perhaps with assurances of American citizenship) into participating in this epic flash mob.

The banks, then packaged the loans hiding the bad loans and sold them to get away from them, since they were KNOWN high risk and shouldn't have ever happened, but the Obamas (both Barack and Michelle) sued to force them to.

ShadowReaperX07,"Alarm Bells:

'Countless guys didn't treat her right'

'Father communicates affection through gifts'

'Gender fluid'

'Cutting people out of her life with different political views'

_________

Yeah, now, i'm not saying everyone that has been subject to abuse and 'daddy issues' will immediately start cutting their friends out of their life, but I am saying there are a couple of other deep seated issues within their life well beyond ""Orange man bad"" under the same pretense that one man (or at a push) two men treating her badly I can empathise with, and I deeply dislike manipulative and/or cruel men (just as any reasonable man or woman would)  but if you learn very little from the experience, or feel that this treatment is just what you're worth, then there is a much deeper issue at work.

Ultimately, it seems there is a pervasive mentality of that rather than wanting to work through a problem (Why do these men treat me badly? Why did my father communicate affection through gifts?) there is a mentality of ""I'll just eliminate anything that reminds me of the problem, rather than 'solving' the problem"".

If I were to be blunt, this is what would be reffered to as 'weakness' or 'weak will'; and no, that is not to suggest that these problems occur 'because they are weak' but rather the responses (and lack of solutions) to these problems are inherently weak in a ""Maybe they'll all just go away"" - Which any one can tell you; they do not.

________

It hurts to lose friends, but ultimately I find that, more often than not, you will keep a very close circle of very close friends whom will actually do exactly as they say; Their actions will certainly match their words and not ring hollow as everyone on social media whom will ""Send hugs"" - often when they live not more than 5-10 miles away, and could easily pop in for half an hour after work, or one afternoon when they are not busy and actually provide some sort of comfort, conversation and company. 

Social Media is 'Creating a more connected world' what they don't tell you is that the full quote is ""Creating a more connected world; where people hardly know each other"". 

_______

Ultimately I can't say how important this friend is to you, and I can't reconcile her reasons for doing what she has. Trust, as they say, is earned. I would wager, that over time this will turn out to benefit you far more than this will benefit her.",2018-10-22,2,The_Donald

Warskull,"&gt; For two years “midterms” has been their rallying cry. If they lose, they will be broken. 

That's why the whole ""blue wave"" started.  They lost hard.  Before Trump announced candidacy the 2018 election should have been an election that was impossible for the Democrats to lose.  They managed to run the worst possible candidate against the best possible candidate and lose it.

The media kept pumping them up and their cult kept telling them they were right and everyone else was wrong.  Their smugness levels were off the chart.  Morale plummeted after Trump won.  In their minds they lost to a idiot orange racist.  All the attacks on Trump and the left believing he was so low makes it really bad when they actually lost.

Now Trump have been delivering win after win and the left is losing all the time.  They need a win.  All the orange man bad screaming, the rioting, the violence, it is pure despair.  If they don't get something they can call a win they will probably lose hope.

I hope the party does disintegrate.  One of the reasons I voted for Trump was because I saw his potential to improve America by destroying both the Republicans and the Democrats.  He already delivered on the Republicans.  He crushed the neo-cons and reforged the party to be more like him.  The democrats disintegrating and reforming would give us two new parties and be very good for America.

If the Democrats fail to take the House and the Senate I expect a huge narrative spin on how they won because they elected more Senators than the Republicans.  They will completely ignore that the Republicans gained sees and tout the large number of Senators in safe blue states getting re-elected as a win.",2018-10-21,3,The_Donald

&gt; Twitter on Tuesday announced a new policy addressing “dehumanizing speech,” which will take effect later this year, and for the first time the public will be able to formally provide the company with feedback on the proposed rule.

&gt; The policy will prohibit “content that dehumanizes others based on their membership in an identifiable group, even when the material does not include a direct target.”

""Orange Man Bad"" basically reduces them to mindless bots, so Twitter bans it.",2018-10-21,5,The_Donald

Although I've always been a Republican at heart, and grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh in my Dad's truck, I never found any political candidate to really support with the exception of Ron Paul. Going into 2016, I sort of expected to support Bernie or somebody on the Left because I thought there would be no good candidates on either side. I knew I didn't want Hillary in there and I really just expected to stop paying attention. I still listen to talk radio and was a little surprised to hear Lars Larson supporting the bad orange man, so I gave Trump a second look.

She dropped what she was doing, sat on her couch, and joined in, complete with fist in the air, ""dump trump! dump trump!""

Then when you say it’s not funny, they get angry and insult you. Now it’s your fault their joke sucks. I think they’re in such a circle jerk that anything anti-trump is praised and laughed at among their peers. Even if it’s been said a million times.  Then outside their group they expect the same result and it falls totally flat.

TerraHertz,"Not to mention that he's not at all 'orange'. His skin tone is completely normal.
Except on the MSM TV screens he looks orange. Why is that? Because making political opponents look orange on TV was an old USSR Communist propaganda trick. An orange face automatically elicits subconscious dislike in viewers. Except of course, being Marxists the Soviet government overdid it, and  pretty much all Russians wised up to this trick.

The US and globalist MSM, being mostly Leftist/Marxists, apparently are still reading the old USSR propaganda textbooks. Hence color shifting Trump's face to look orange, then having their net astroturfing operations fill the net with 'orange man bad' scripts. Which the NPCs echo mindlessly, because they are NPCs.

Anyway, it's a useful reveal. Any TV coverage of Trump in which his face looks orange, is being produced by Marxist infiltrators.",2018-10-17,45,The_Donald

SordidPontification,"I almost wanted to agree with this sentiment at first, but I think it's mistaking the escalation of the conflict and the shear genius of the NPC meme (namely the language + avatar). After all, if everyone is using the *same* avatar, it's not that much of a stretch to either a) match the hash of the avatar to automatically remove/ban the account or b) failing that, running a matching algorithm against the uploaded (and very slightly different) avatars. Obviously, this would *work*, but my idea is absolutely still valid even if it is some steps away. It also gives us a path forward when the bans continue.

So, consider it planning for the future.

In any case, I think the idea would only work if you still use the same language and motifs (e.g. ""orange man bad""). This could be akin to an arms race where the endgame creates a landscape in which you have a few hilarious possibilities: The first where Twitter doesn't quite know who to delete, the second where leftists on Twitter slowly become uncertain about who is mocking them and who isn't (I concede this is more dubious), and finally, the third where curious onlookers are left wondering why people who seem to agree with each other are yelling and screaming that the other is a bot.

That would be absolute chaos.

Now, there's obviously some other issues with this plan, besides the ones you've pointed out. The most obvious I can think of is that using a corpus of ""donated"" (heh) avatars would be subject to some analysis from Twitter. Obviously, the site I used as an example harvests their sources from Twitter directly, so it's not out of the question that they could just examine accounts using avatars from donor accounts. There are some things you could do to throw this off, at least temporarily (flip image, slight hue/brightness changes), but it wouldn't be permanent. It doesn't matter, though, because the objective is something that can be sustainable in the long term via a change in tactics. My suggestion is just one of many ways forward, albeit after most other avenues are exhausted.

I've found this meme to be so hilarious and truthful! I was on the front lines with you on YouTube (because I don't have a Twitter). Watching this awesome meme grow organically has been absolutely amazing. I voted Dem in 2016 (Not Hillary, I wrote in a better D), but I am voting 100% R next month and again in 2020. Trump won me over, the mob proved that I was wrong to vote D in 2016, and the toxicity that spawned this meme is the core of why I am realizing that I've been leaning conservative this whole time and the left has been a festering scab on my political views.  I had a few beers for Brett tonight. I've labeled my snowblower ""The Kavanaugh"" because nothing is better at throwing ice.

Did he bait them knowing what they would do and that they couldn’t stop once they started?  Getting the narrative against you to be so outlandish just makes the low information segment have doubts on their own like a spontaneous red pill. There are people out there who don’t ever talk politics to anyone else, watch the news or research anything on their own. Those people are only aware of the outside world through osmosis. For those people there is a certain point where their perception of what is going on gets so far from what they personally perceive in their little world that they have to question how they believe the outside world to be.

Natasha_Fatale_Woke,"Georgia pede here.  In terms of Stacey Abrams as a candidate, it's not clear if she has the basic management skills necessary for running a large, complex organization such as the state government of Georgia.  Abrams' previous management experience as director of the New Georgia Project could not be called a success:

""**At the end of 2013, the Atlanta lawmaker founded an initiative called the New Georgia Project that set an ambitious goal of registering at least 120,000 minority voters across the state by the 2014 midterm elections.**

Though she raised at least $3 million in donations—more money than Barack Obama spent in Georgia during either of his presidential campaigns—**Abrams’ effort ultimately registered just 46,000 people**...

The New Georgia Project has been criticized for its lack of transparency and its failure to live up to its expectations.

“She hasn’t been open and transparent,” state Sen. Vincent Fort, another Democrat from Atlanta, told us. “Her funders don’t know where her money went. More importantly, the public doesn’t know where the money went.” Mayor Kasim Reed has also questioned the need for the New Georgia Project.

“I don’t believe nor did I believe that the New Georgia Project is the model [for voter registration],” Reed told the Atlanta Journal Constitution last June. “I think that you have professional organizations that are experts at building the voter database in states, and I think that they should be a part of the overall political campaign...""

https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/the-new-new-georgia-project-stacey-abramss-10-million-plan-to-double-down-on-voter-registration/ 

So Abrams' organizational management skills are poor, her financial management skills are poor, and the main policy platform that she's pushing is 'vote for me because I'm black and female.'  Doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence.  I'm not thrilled about voting for Kemp (think he should have recused himself as SoS in this election) but the Democratic Party needs to understand that simply presenting a combination of identity politics and 'orange man bad' isn't going to win them elections.  And if they win this one they will triple down on identity politics.  ",2018-10-13,8,The_Donald

Trump understands what motivates people. He knows Eminem's career thrives off of drama with other celebrities. Just like MGK got a ton of free publicity from Eminem's  response, Eminem was hoping to get a ton of free publicity to Trump.

It's also not really a wise choice to get into a battle of words with Eminem. The best and most painful response Trump could have given was just to ignore him altogether, which is basically saying 'You're not relevant enough for me to care about your insults.' ",2018-10-12,8,The_Donald

You are incapable of defending your positions, which is why your party will never succeed and why socialism fails everywhere it is attempted and ends in genocide.

Legion_TD,"What is really funny is you think you are an intellectual. In reality you are not even spouting off your own thoughts. I was a liberal in early 2016. I decided to reevaluate my believes and did some independent research. I’m not going to go into much detail, but pretty much everything that you think you believe and you know is an absolute out right lie.

I am going to laugh so fucking hard when the Mueller report is released and nothing implicates Trump.

He is by far the most scrutinized and survey old president and candidate in the history of United States and they haven’t found a goddamn thing.

The leftist corruption in the DOJ and FBI is staggering. You had people within those departments illegally running a counter Intel op on a candidate - based on bullshit. The fact that you think anything that you do in relation to that issue means you hate America. America does not stand for this bullshit.

I genuinely feel bad for you. You think you’re an intellectual but you are a pseudo-intellectual that has no capacity to think for themselves.

So now I’m going to get Internet Points taken away because I’m gonna be a dick. I’m far smarter than you. I have more degrees than you. I make a lot more money than you. And I’m far more well-informed than you are.

You’re probably for censorship in removing the ability for people like Alex Jones to speak. I know that you’re a moron. I don’t wanna take away your right to speak. I’ll defend your ability to have the rights that you are given by God. If I saw you getting beaten on the street by antifa. I would jump in and defend you.

That’s the difference between leftist morons and socialist fuck sticks and conservatives. We don’t have to like you to want to defend you which is why you cowardly leftist pieces of shit 
Don’t deserve the benefits that the Constitution gives you because you want to tear it down and tear down the military that protects you every single fucking day.

My proof that you are a pseudo- intellectual? Did you read the US MCA agreement? Do you understand that a significant bump of goods must be made in the US? That’s more revenue and more work and more GDP to be produced from the US.   All in all the USMCA agreement. Add about 20% of revenue to the US in trade between those three countries.

The fact that you’re calling it a loss or at best neutral is a giant fucking joke.

The fact of the matter is every single person in this country legally is better of for him being president. People are paying less payroll taxes , less federal income tax, Manufacturing jobs have come back to the tune of 400,000-ish in 18 months record high stock markets which are now in jeopardy because the fair is jacking up rates at a rate which we haven’t seen since the 1980s which caused the stock market crash, and there’s peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Go into your little hole where everything is bad and Trump bad orange man bad. You’re a moron go back to your micro aggressions and snowflake mentality.

I’m gonna go back to my awesome life my awesome job and back to winning every fucking day enjoying the country that I love, seeing the constitution upheld and preserved, in owning moron pseudo-intellectual lives like you every fucking day

Unfortunately, you’ll only change things by having a civil war and doing the work the military regime didn’t do. Killing 30,000, starting with FHC [former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso]. Killing. If a few innocent people die, that’s alright.”""

This was 30 years ago. He's changed. He's said many times he wants to do things democratically. He just reiterated this on TV today because of some stupid statements of his VP. He was in Congress for a very long time and never ever attempted anything undemocratic. He has support of the military and never ever attempted anything undemocratic.

Also you can't know what he really really thinks. He might be saying this now to get votes. Just as he could have said that back then to get votes from the military, which were his niche. That quote is useless. It can't have more value than what he's been saying for the last 10 years to any reasonable person.

Also you quoted me saying that him being an asshole is non sequitur to ""he is a thief"". You haven't proved he's a thief with this quote.

&gt; ""They don’t do anything. I don’t think they’re even good for procreation any more” – referring to quilombolas, the black descendants of rebel African slaves.""

Why is that racist? If they were whites it would be OK? That is strictly his oppinion. He was sued for that and nothing happened, even with our Supreme Court (who judged him) being mostly left wing progressists. They precisely decided that it didn't extrapolate his free speech right and it just stated an opinion. You know better than our Supreme Court?

&gt; “I’m not going to rape you, because you’re very ugly”

That quote is false. Don't spread misinformation. He said ""I don't rape you because you don't deserve it"". That was in answer to being called a rapist. Fuck that bitch who called him a rapist.

&gt; Hes anti-thetical to democracy and to freedom. 

He's not. He is doing everything and will keep doing everything according to our laws. He has swore by the Constitution many times and has condemned PT for trying to craft a new Constitution. 

&gt; Also, this strong man bullshit doesn't work. Look at Eastern Europe. They have lived by the strong militaristic leader for the past 200 years and they're still shit countries with no economy. Hell people wish they would return to the soviet union.

He is better for the economy than his adversary, the thieve's puppet Haddad.

&gt; He sympathizes with corrupt regimes too. So IDK why you're saying he doesn't. 

He did. And he said he was wrong. He has been condemning them for many years now. PT still is in cahoots with dictatorships. 


Also, and this is the key point which you seem to keep avoiding, all this is irrelevant. I don't care if he is straight, gay, homophobe, transphobe, super tolerant or whatever. He has no power to strip freedoms from any group of people. Congress wouldn't allow that. This isn't a dictatorship. There are checks and balances in place.

Once he's elect people won't go to concentration camps, they won't lose their jobs, they won't be ostracized, etc. Nothing of this will happen. Just as it didn't happen when bad orange man started his term. Stop with the idiocy.

The only thing we should care about is how the economy will run. How the administration will run. He's better for that than the opposition.

And again I tell you: an idiot is better than a thief. It's amazing how you seem to keep avoiding the MAMMOTH in the room that is his opposition. I am NOT saying he is not a moron. He is. He is a complete imbecile. His opposition is comprised of THIEVES, gangsters who robbed the fucking country.

still-at-work,"Probably best for as many Democrats as possible to vote Republican in 2018 to save the democrat party. Democrats current leadership looks to reinforce the ideals and strategy displayed during the judical sub committee hearings. But if they lose in a large enough way in the election perhaps there will be a internal party revolt. Dems should treat Nancy Pelosi like they did Thurman. A crazy old person that keeps getting reelected for some reason, but not give her positions of power in their party. Otherwise they will keep losing voters to Trump giant centrist tent.

And as an Independent who leans conservative, I remember how screwed up the GOP was when it was lead by neocons. This could happen again and we need a strong opposing party to challenge the GOP. Historically, GOP with too much power is as much a threat to it's own ideology then the dems. I think they need the foil of the left to keep them honest. The GOP voter needs to believe the dems are not lead by insane people so they can afford to punish their many times idiot politicians by not voting for them. 

Trump has turned out great, while he is a jerk to the press and on social media, on policy choices he is doing incredible. But if we are being honest we didn't know if he would keep his promises in 2016, just that he would be better then Clinton. 

But imagine if Trump was a bad president, that he was indecisive and prone to folding to pressure from the press and a host of other paid qualities in a president. With how insane the left is right now could we punish Trump and his party by electing who ever the left picks with their superdelegates in 2020? No, we would need to reward bad behavior.

Perhaps Trump will permanently alter the GOP's platform and instill in them a willingness to stick to their policy choices in the face of pressure from the press. But we have no guarentee that post Trump the party will let the neocons run it again. The GOP primary is far more wide open then the dem one, evidenced by the Tea Party movement and Trump himself, but established politicians with the right connections still have a leg up on everyone else. 

I don't want one party rule even if it's the party I ideologically agree with, because then internal party politics becomes more important then actual policies. Not to mention that gives rise to corruption. Trump needs the dems to be crazy to unit the GOP behind him. Without their current insanity there is no way he could get support from many of GOP. 

As a case study, Trump's trade policies are not popular with many on the right since they ideologically oppose tariffs of any kind. But Trump is only using tariffs to drive other nations to the negotiating table. He is not using tariffs to generate revenue. The 4 billion or so they have made so far is a drop in the bucket compared to the revenue recieved from income taxes from free trade. However if he can get new deals that protect manufacturing jobs the growth of the economy and the resulting tax revenues will outstrip everything. Trump drops the tariffs as soon as he gets the trade deal because they are not the end goal, the trade deals are the goal.

Many on the right and the left have no idea that this is Trumps master plan on trade, even though he has stated it as much very clearly when asked. The left opposed it because they can't see past 'Orange man bad' and the right oppose it because they can't shake off the short term simplistic thinking of 'all tariffs bad'.

Yet Trump is succeeding with his Trade policies. Could any other GOP hopeful in 2016 pull off this delicate game of tariff to deal with huge economic powers while their supporters and many GOP in congress scream 'tariffs bad'? Doesn't seem likely to me.

So while the Trump probably needs the insanity that has gripped the Democrat party to continue to further unite the GOP behind his policies, I do hope the Dems get their act together and act rationally eventually. Because I fear a post Trump GOP reverting back to its neocon days except this time we have no recourse but to support them since if Antifa is where the left is heading then no matter how bad a neocon is, the dems would be worse. 

Remember the tea party movement happened after McCain. Those voters stayed home when Obama got elected. However if it was Clinton vs McCain then McCain would have probably won. The proto tea party voter could stomach Obama with his hope and change but not the Clinton's 'rules don't apply to me, ever' mentality. You may or may not prefer such an alt history but it does highlight the importance to right wing ideology to have the left side not be run by identity politics authoritarians.",2018-10-09,17,The_Donald

His record as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy was dismal. He piled up demerits left and right for breaking the rules, and barely passed his schoolwork, graduating 894th in a class of 899.

He barely passed flight school. And then he crashed two airplanes and damaged a third.

In the end, he wrecked a total of 5 planes, making him an enemy ACE. I wonder if he had 5 American flags on the side of his cockpit?

The first crash took place during advanced flight training at Corpus Christi, Texas. According to McCain, the engine stalled while he was practicing landings. The plane fell into the water of the bay just off the airfield and knocked him unconscious. McCain woke up and somehow managed to get out of the cockpit and escaped serious injury. Investigators reported that they started the recovered engine without any problem, and their report left open the possibility of pilot error.

The next accident took place in Spain while McCain was assigned to an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea. He tried to fly his propeller-driven A-1 fighter-bomber under a row of pylon-supported electric power lines. This was a “hotdogging” stunt by U.S. pilots in Europe that had caused outrage. McCain’s plane hit and damaged the lines so badly that thousands of people lost power.

“My daredevil clowning had cut off electricity to a great many Spanish homes,” McCain wrote later, “and created a small international incident.”

In 1965, McCain flew a navy airplane to Philadelphia to attend the Army-Navy football game. On the way back to his base in Norfolk, Virginia, the plane’s engine quit, he said, so he bailed out. The plane crashed and was destroyed.

On the morning of July 29, 1967, McCain was sitting in the cockpit of his Skyhawk waiting to be launched by the ship’s catapult.

In an attempt to impress the pilot behind him, he did a ""wet start"" an intentional backfire, touching off a fire that spread rapidly across the ship, and causing a ZUNI missile to drop to the deck. McCain managed to escape injury, but 134 sailors died and many others were badly burned.

It was the worst U.S. Navy accident since World War Two and the fourth serious accident McCain had been involved in since becoming a pilot. His reputation for being a “hotdog”—a show-off pilot who broke the rules—caused other pilots to hate him, even though the fire was ruled accidental.

And the strike that got McCain captured by the enemy?.... 
By his own admission, then, McCain failed to follow instructions in combat. He flew below the hard deck.  The pilots who were flying near him, one of them with a handheld camera, said he was not hit by a SAM. He had flown too low and was brought down by a barrage of antiaircraft fire. Since a SAM exploded in a bright orange fireball visible for miles around, it was unlikely that they had called it wrong. And since official navy records listed John McCain as downed by AAA fire, they were puzzled by why he later insisted in his political campaigns that it was a SAM.

As other pilots saw it, John McCain, quite simply, had got himself shot down.

But McCain also made another error in the next four to six seconds after he was hit. He failed to use the proper procedure he had been taught for ejecting. As a result, he injured himself critically, breaking both arms and his right leg.

McCain was a traitor and collaborator, while being held captive. He was given preferential treatment, due to the fact that his captors felt he was 'royalty', due to his family 'connections'. They didn't understand why someone SO 'connected' was putting himself in 'harm's way'. Different culture than ours.

His ""shoot down"" was self-induced, as he DISOBEYED ORDERS and flew well below the 'floor', getting himself shot down. There were several other jets on that particular mission and HE was the only one shot down, because the others obeyed their orders!

His ENTIRE life has been one of disrespect of orders and authority, believing himself bullet-proof, due to his 'family name' and his dad and grand dad being HIGH ranking Navy Admirals!

His 'nickname' in his HS yearbook was ""Punk"" and he displayed that behavior as he went on to the USNA, where he robbed someone, more deserving, of a slot in his class, due to the 'influence' of his father.

He SHOULD have been expelled, several times, but the folks at USNA did not want to go up against dad. He graduated FIFTH FROM THE BOTTOM in his class . . but STILL ended up going to Pensacola for flight training! His classmates who actually 'made the grade' were aghast when he showed up down there.

His flight grades were well below acceptable and he should have been run out of there too . . he was an ABYSMAL aviator . . crashing on base leg at Corpus for carrier qualification training. . he had been out drinking the night before and FELL ASLEEP after turning base leg and 'configuring' for landing . . he crashed 'wings level' and straight ahead into Corpus Bay . . too bad for us he wasn't over land . . story would have ended there.

He destroyed two other A/C after arriving in the Fleet . . before being shot down.

His nickname in Hanoi was ""Songbird"". . due to the information he willingly gave his captors. . tactical stuff. .like 'routes, altitudes', etc., that our guys used to fly from the boat to their targets and he got several of his fellow aviators shot down and killed. He recorded 32+ propaganda bits (a la Tokyo Rose) to be played for our enlisted troops . . to undermine their moral.

After his release, his Navy 'flying career' SHOULD have been over, based upon his permanent injuries, but, his dad intimidated a flight surgeon and he wrongly got back his flight medical status, when ANYONE else would NOT have 'passed' with his 'condition'. He was 'awarded' the position of XO at the Navy's largest training squadron, VA-174 at NAS Cecil and when the CO moved on, he was 'selected', over MANY more qualified officers, to become CO. .he used his position as XO and CO to take young (junior) female pilots on X-Country flights and screwed their brains out.

EVERYONE knew what he was doing . . THAT is ILLEGAL in the military and he SHOULD have been convicted at Court Martial for 'fraternization' . .INSTEAD . .daddy got him moved out of the squadron and put in charge of the Navy's ""Liaison"" in DC . . along with a VERY early promotion to Captain . . the rest, as they say, is history.

John McCain was a scum bag . . a DISGRACE to the uniform he wore and his spots did not change when he became a politician!

Do a GOOGLE . . there is a LOT more stuff out there. .BUT, this snippet, below, is REALLY DAMNING . . there are some 'heavy hitter', respected politicians and leaders on there, calling McCain the treasonous SCUM he IS!!

I will add that when McCain returned to the United States he dumped his partially disabled wife (from an auto accident) and married a trophy bride.

He went on to become the most despised member of Congress. So disliked was he that when he ran against Dubya Busu, hardly a shining star, he only received the support of two other members of congress.

He was caught on video berating the family of a POW/MIA and had numerous complaints about his callous and rude treatment of the families.

And there is much, much more . . .

No, I will not mourn the passing of this man.

REMEMBER:
McCain, referred to as ""wetstart"", would spin up his Skyhawk, turn on the fuel and let it pour into the engine &amp; on the deck. He then hit the ignition and enjoyed the huge 'bang' that followed. On the day the over 100 sailors died, traitor McCain let too much fuel puke out and it started a huge fire. The missile incident was BECAUSE of the fire. In their haste to get out of their planes to safety, a missile DROPPED TO THE DECK. That missile hit the superstructure killing many sailors. The fire finished off many more sailors.

bill_in_texas,"Welcome!  Considering the toxic and corrosive state of society these days, especially the violence and vitriol we see from the left, your parents probably didn't discuss their political beliefs because they worried you would repeat them to others, and suffer reprisal or repression because of it.  For example.  If one or several of your teachers are devoted liberals, and you walk in singing the praises of Trump, or conservatism, or really, anything pro-America, that might irritate your teacher(s), and they might retaliate against you.  Same with your classmates.  If they have grown up in a toxic environment of ""orange man bad"" hate, their own kids probably picked up on that, so when they hear you say something that challenges what their parents have taught them, they very well could lash out against you.  

I encourage you to remain interested in politics, and more generally, the world around you.  We need informed adults to shape our future, so even if you end up disagreeing with us about certain issues, at least you have done your own research, evaluated the arguments yourself, and made your own decisions.

phoenix335,"It is the same old. The left is projecting, as always.

They are far more fixated on Trump than we are, which the ""insult"" illustrates nicely. Their narrative requires them to believe that we are here only because of Trump and that we would go away or cease to believe what we believe if Trump went away. The literal opposite is true. Trump is what and where he is because of us. He was the wake-up call, the reason and method to wake up, but not the reason why we stay awake. 

As always, NPCs cannot draw conclusions or make decisions different from their script and that script went off the rails on election night. ""Orange man and fans bad / backwards / mean / brutish"".

Hmm... Well it will target Trump since *orange man bad* is their only platform policy this election cycle. So what aspect of the Trump cycle will they pick to hype up around end the month?

Possible but there is isn't much there to use. Trump's trade policies are destroying the economy? No, the economy is working too well right now, need ro piviot from it.

My guess is it will be immigrantion again, specifically the speration of children from their parents at the borders. Sure its a policy started under Bill Clinton and was continued through Bush, Obama, and yes Trump. Sure the only way to fix it is for immigrantion reform laws pass through congress. This didn't help as a direct attack against Trump but its a pretty good attack and call to arms for a mid terms.

What I found, was that the big bad Orange man wasn't so terrible.  He was a fighter, and imperfect, but he loved our country entirely.  

He had flaws, but I have flaws, and America has flaws, and we all are flawed, but.... we are also massively accomplished in spite of them.

We are swimmers even when there is no land on the horizon.

Trump, won me over by showing love for what we are without apology.  He won me over with bravery, when instead of fleeing from a would-be assassin, he stood firm and stared that assassin down with steely glare.

burneraccount2scoops,"Dear US Senate,

&amp;#x200B;

I was a loser in high school.  Brett was kind of a dork/brain but he worked really hard at athletics and was able to use this to his advantage in terms of being accepted by the jocks and popular kids.  When the jocks would pick on the dorks, Brett would laugh.  Like all of us, he wanted to be cool.  We were all really jealous that Brett was so smart and yet still able to hang out with the cool kids.

What pisses me off the most, is that Brett was seen as cool enough at the time, that he totally could have gotten laid.  But he chose not to.  I'm super pissed because he BASICALLY LIED and would act like he was getting pussy.  But he was not.  I would have given anything to get pussy but I was just to much of a bitch!  Fuck Brett!

I'm really not jealous of him for a million reasons.  I just think that he is really really bad and will let orange man destroy the country so I could not keep quiet about this.  Plus the girl that I am still in love with from high school posted stuff on Facebook about how he is really bad and I am still trying to impress her/ get her to remember my name.

DancinginAshes,"Obama and Hillary are also rolling out PR op appearances as well, just in time to fire up those Democratic voters in 60%+ Democratic states and districts.  Meanwhile here in Texas, Beto O'Rourke's campaign had to ask Obama not to endorse him, because Obama and Clinton endorsements in tight races drive Republicans to the polls at a prodigious rate.    


This whole farce with sexual assault allegations from 36 years ago is doing more to awaken Trump voters than it is Democrats.  The only Democrats it seems to be firing up are the morons who have been posting lame memes about Orange Man Bad for the past two years, aka people who were already engaged and who were going to vote Democrat in the midterms.  For middle of the road people who tend to vote Democrat in presidential elections but aren't committed to the party, I'm not seeing them having any political conversations on Facebook and the election is only a month away.

The best way to sabotage a Democratic candidate is to give frequent media appearances to the national party leadership, because Clinton, Pelosi, Feinstein, Obama, etc. are all full of shit and the layman can sense it.

Then there is his comment on how these trade agreements actually help a lot of blue collar workers including helping mexican trade unions. 

Clearly the author didn't get the memo, the Democrat Party doesn't care about actual workers anymore. Sure the union leaders still give them money but then those union leaders have given them money for decades and the dems never helped the union members before, why start now. Donald Trump won a lot of blue collar workers in 2016, and in the next two years I have seen absolutely nothing from the democrat party in trying to woe them back. I can only assume they abanded them for what they determined are better and growing voter blocks.

The author of this piece will no doubt be given the riot act by his editor soon and told to get in line. He may even be put on adminstrative leave for even this tepid acknowledgement that something Trump worked on is working. Its too bad because it seems he may be one of the few true worker rights liberals left at CNN. One who can accept reality in front of him.

We joke about ""Y P PO"" and ""orange man bad"", but for a lot of their supporters, that is the limit of their thought process. They teach kids to be stupid and weak in schools, then to go onto college for full indoctrination for marxism, confusing them and striking them with mental illnesses before they even work their first job. The youth is at war with itself. They know that dignified people will not vote for them, so they just open the borders so that they can throw crumbs at the undignified; like bread to pigeons. They are the party of lies and deceit. They convinced the entire country that they just magically started loving black people in the 60s after years of mistreatment, only for years of poverty and broken communities to follow. What are we to do with proud, self-righteous bold faced liars. I would love if midterms go our way, but I think the reality is that hard times are up ahead and we need to be ready for them.

 Who wants higher taxes, loads of illegal immigrants, government regulations on every facet of life, legalized sexualization of children, killing of the unborn at any time for any reason?

I am glad you have been able to free your mind. Help others and accept the slings and arrows with grace. Ask them if there are any more names they would like to call the president or yourself if you are their target. Name calling is a childish thing. Show them how childish they are being. Ask them if they have understanding of the issue. Define the terms and the history of the topic. Once you have a common understanding you can begin to communicate.
     
If they can't get off of ""Orange Man Is Bad"" tell them that Trump loves this country and all of its citizens even ""you"". He ended Isis lowered taxes and is fighting for fair trade. He wants a secure border so people can stop dying to drug overdoses and gang violence. He wants Americans to have more jobs and better jobs.

sun_wolf,"Yeah, could be, I agree. Michael Savage has revealed new evidence showing she has connections to CIA and FusionGPS. 

That said, if you watch the testimony, and especially that last part, it really appears as though she got thunderstruck by the revelation that her own lawyers broke official protocol for sex crime victims - protocol that was specifically designed to protect the victim's anonymity and emotional/mental well-being. 

Now it's also possible that she's only a pawn in all of this, and they've only told her as much as she needs to know to accomplish her part in the goal. But let's say the charges are false and *she knows* they are false. And let's say she knows it's unethical to make false allegations of sexual assault against an innocent man, but she's rationalized the need to do this because ""muh resist"" and ""muh orange dictator"". Certainly a Democrat of today could easily do that, right? In their mind, Kavanaugh, as a white man, was born guilty anyway, so this could be rationalized as payback and social justice. And let's say she's keeping her lie close to her chest and not letting her lawyers in on it, for her own protection. 

Now what happens when she finds out they just broke official protocol for victims of sex crimes? 

It would instantly show her that her lawyers, who don't know she is lying, would have betrayed her emotional and mental well-being *had she been an actual victim*. And that is a greater ""Are we the bad guys?"" moment than her deciding to make false allegations against Kavanaugh because she has to resist Trump. This would ramp it up to: my own lawyers, and the Democrat Party, who actually believe my story, just knowingly broke official protocol for sex crime victims for political benefit *which reveals they do not actually care about the victims of sex crimes*.

We hold non violent rallies that only have the call to vote and not take up arms, but we still respect people owning arms because (and here is the kicker) even when our side is power right now, we still don't implicitly trust it.

We have conflicts with other nations and support using tariffs and not bombs to change their behavior. We want to stop buying oil from the middle east so we are not tied to its instability anymore. We support a President who is helping bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. Don't want to give him credit because Orange Man bad? Fine, but the world is a safer place then it was two years ago so something is going right.

We want good economic policies that benefit people of all socioeconomic classes by promoting manufacturing and increasing wages of average workers for the first time in years while lowering the tax burden to promote investment and growth of all industries.

Finally, If only we didn't know that Clinton rigged the primaries against Sanders more then usual (with super delegates ever dem primary is rigged by design) then we would have abandon all our policies positions and voted for wife of a disgraced fomer president who was a terrible secretary of state that let one of her ambassadors get murdered by terrorists under her watch and then blamed a YouTube video for it and the called us all deplorable in the campaign.  

But because we didn't let Hillary win because it was ""her turn"" we are authoritarian fascists who only want to destroy.

3) Mitch (most likely) and swamp will call on Trump to request FBI to conduct investigation

5) FBI investigation will show squat. All 3 accusations are horseshit.

I’d love to have that. Then I could determine whether I like him for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. Instead we get this shitshow and all it does is make me want to put him on the bench immediately.

I feel the same way about Trump. I’d love to have a nuanced discussion about trade and foreign policy and stuff, but it’s difficult when the only response is “REE” and “Orange Man Bad!” I de facto support everything he does simply because the other side is so incoherent.

erogilus,"Session is the crouching tiger at this point. He's waiting for the moment to strike, which will likely be right after midterms settle.

Remember when Sessions was nominated? The left excoriated him, calling him a ""racist white man from Alabama,"" despite his track record of championing for minorities. It was just ""we hate anyone Trump nominates"" outrage, which we have seen for practically all his Cabinet. We weren't even sure if Session was going to be confirmed, it was 52-47 in February 2017.

Now fast forward to today. The whole bluster from Trump against Sessions has caused the left to defend Session. The same person they decried as a racist, now they defend as a paragon of justice and staying ""non-political"" unlike ""the big bad orange man"".

Think about it. If Trump was **truly** unhappy with Sessions, why not fire him now? Why not just call him on the phone directly instead of using social media? It's a bluff, it's a trap and they are eating it up -- because they're stupid.

So now when Sessions goes after the Swamp, the left can't say he's ""playing politics"" or ""acting as Trump's hitman"" because they already established Sessions is impartial and fair. It's all about optics, and the left is falling for the trap so excellently.

Once Kavanaugh is in, you'll see the FISA declassification stuff drop soon after. We need SC swing vote to make sure we don't get derailed with ""unconstitutional"" delay tactics. After midterms, Red Wave 2.0 will be realized, and it's going to be smooth sailing.

still-at-work,"The NYT gained its prominent spot amoung the nations newspapers by have high journalistic standards. By required two named sources for every story. This was in contrast to the tabloid competition of the new york world and new york journal.  Those are the two papers that used ""fake news"", then known as yellow journalism, to start a war between Spain and the United States. But the new york times was a broadsheet, the grey lady, the one you could trust. It didn't rely on sensational headlines and vauge sources to sell papers but just all the news that's fit to print. Those days are dead now. Clearly the NYT is just another tabloid paper, one that has been cashing in its history of respect for a few years of fooling people they haven't completely converted into a tabloid. But I think the jig is up and the public has figured it out. 

Perhaps journalistic standards can't compete in a world with the internet and social media, but I disagree, I think it would allow such news sources to stand out. Then again tabloid papers always had great appeal to the public. It wasn't until the public figured out they had been fooled into an unneeded war that they start to perfer more trustworthy stories. Pulitizer started his famous prize by wanted to get away from the tabloid journalism he promoted and made a fortune off of, because he feared its affect on the democratic process. 

We already had the New York Times lie us into the war with Iraq but the public didn't lose trust in the old grey lady. Now because 'Orange Man Bad' they have dropped any pretence of standards. Journalism isn't dead in America but non tabloid journalism is basically gone in the mainstream. Its no longer about selling the truth, its about selling the message that's popular to sell.

MC-noob,"Excellent breakdown. Now ask the question ""why does the left keep doing this?"" Definition of insanity, right?

The MSM's job isn't to inform the populace, it's to push narratives. And even before the '16 election the narrative has been ""ORANGE MAN BAD"" at all costs. For the past couple of years, all of these events and articles have followed the same tone/template - ""here's what happened today, and here's why Trump is BAD"". This isn't an accident, these articles are being pushed from big-name sources like the NYT or WaPo or coming from the AP newswire and being spread across hundreds of local newspapers and stations. It's a constant drumbeat that's designed to reinforce the narrative that their Deep State masters want pushed.

The folks on the left who are constantly crying salty tears and are constantly having TDS-induced breakdowns are being led by the nose, led to believe in some ridiculous conspiracy theory about Russia stealing our election or whatever, and they're kept in a constant state of panic and stress by the day-to-day reinforcement of that narrative. 

Once you recognize it for the psyop that it is, it's easy to see how it's done, easy to pick through the news and point out the obvious propaganda and watch as the ""resistance"" sways back and forth to the drumbeat of the people manipulating them.",2018-09-04,32,The_Donald

two_womps,I recently had a discussion with my 5th grader because the class had talked about DACA and kids getting separated from their families. In a way I get it - kids are talking about it and some of them might get scared. I also think the role of the adult in the room is to calm everyone down and combat the hysteria with facts. Not use the opportunity to tell the kids “everything you heard is true. The president is a poopy head. Orange man bad.”,2018-08-26,23,The_Donald

SolenoidsOverGears,"I would consider myself a Conservative Republican or libertarian. I work in politics, and even helped with the campaign for the Big D. My experience with both of these Subs has been interesting. 

I believe about 85 to 90% of what Donald Trump does as policy is really really great. I believe about 60% of what he says or tweets is pretty great as well. And about 40% of the time, he shoots his fuckin' mouth off and hits himself in the foot.  

On r/politics, any comments other than ""orange man bad"" or any comment on policy to the right of Marx is immediately downvoted to hell. Even the most moderate conservative viewpoints are not to be tolerated. Hell, even DNC talking points from the 90's like ""safe legal and rare"" are too far to the right for that sub. 

Here in T_D, criticism of President Trump is not always taken well. I like the guy. I supported him for a reason. But saying ""hmm, he really shot himself in the foot there."" Isn't always taken well. I think part of it is a certain amount of collectivist tribalism among the right to protect our own. you've got most of the major newspapers, celebrities, TV stations, colleges, et cetera... Against you. Why heap dirt on your own guys, even when they deserve criticizing? Let the other people do that. There's no shortage of them. Just my perspective. 

If I want reasonable criticism from anyone, I usually can find it on libertarian pages and Outlets. They don't have any candidates to defend, so for them it's all raw policy. I like that. And they're just as happy to heap a little dirt on Trump as they were on Obama. ",2018-08-17,12,The_Donald

Their plan - and it's a reasonably good one - is just to keep the hysteria and outrage high and keep it *ever-changing*. That way when people look back, they won't remember any one specific story, which could be debunked, but instead they will remember this four-year wash of negativity and think, ""OrANge MaN bAd"". 

And for the Republicans, independents, libertarians, classic liberals, moderates, and centrists - who *are* paying attention! and *are* looking into the specifics of each claim - this 24/7 hysteria and non-stop negative reporting is designed to demoralize and distract us. 

Sure, the strategy also backfires, since their extreme over-reaction red-pills normies, but at this point I think they're so terrified they don't even care about the normies any more. This is about consolidating and preserving their radical base. ",2018-08-17,3,The_Donald

It tries to tie the movement to more modern times by mentioning that another journalist wrote about abolishing the presidency in the NYT after Nixon won his second term. 

Then it closes by plugging a Comedy Central show, saying ""Reee autocrat"", and saying ""c'mon guys, we really gotta ban the presidency"".

Moreover, their decisions, and influence are not directly subject to election laws.

I hate Trump but this balloon is an absolute fucking joke. We've been hearing about this thing from the UK media for *weeks.* Sadiq Khan approved it and it was hyped up as if it was gonna be this blimp sized balloon being paraded over the centre of London, instead we got this tiny potato shaped thing that never even flew anywhere and cost between 10 and 30 grand from what I've read from different sources. 

I'd have been more okay with it if the media treated it like what it is - a pisstake - but instead we were told about this thing forever as if it was this grand and powerful statement to the evil Trump. ""Yeah that'll show them, we'll have a Trump-baby balloon hover over a square in London. That'll teach those Trump supporters."" All they've done is laugh at it. 

This is all Sadiq Khan does. He says good PR statements and approves shit like this and people go nuts because he said ""Orange man bad"", ignoring the fact that he's been a pretty terrible mayor of London so far and his policies haven't achieved anything good.

Yes there are more dangerous, i.e. greater mortality rate, jobs than being a cop.  The difference is that giving a gun to fisherman or a logger isn't going to save the fisherman from drowning or the logger from being crushed by a fall tree.  The gun and body armor is going to save the cop though.  
  
&gt; The problem is ANYTHING that happens while on duty is considered in the line of duty. Had a heart attack because you are an obese patrolmen struggling to get out their cruiser? K.I.A.  
  
You realize all job death statistics are like that.  Any death while working is going to be counted in that professions mortality rate.  Why should police mortality rates be calculated differently?  
  
I've used that page as evidence for the murder rate of cops, so yes I'm aware of the wide range of causes of death.  That page even reports the deaths of police dogs.  
  
&gt; WOW! 129 in a whole year? That's it? That's nothing!   
  
Hi James Comey. I didn't realize you had a reddit account.  
What's the number of dead cops that you find unacceptable?  
And just FYI the ODMP site lists 135 cops died in 2017, 58 were murdered.  
  
&gt; Meanwhile over 1,100 roofers died the same year.  
  
Would having body armor or a firearm help keep 1,100 roofers alive? Are they going to shoot gravity so that they don't fall to their death?  
  
Do you begrudge the roofer getting more advanced safety gear? Do you tell the logger he shouldn't have chainsaw resistant pants?  
  
&gt; Cops do NOT need to be militarized like that. Period. They do not need fucking up armorered humvees, MRAPS, and the other crazy shit local sheriffs offices have.  
  
That's not for you to decide.  How many roofers were murdered on the job in 2017?  The bureau of labor statistics says ZERO.  
  
&gt; Why do the need anti-mine/I.E.D vehicles? They don't.  
  
Seeing as to how Bomb is a cause of death category on the ODMP site, I'd argue those vehicles are a good thing to have.  
  
&gt; Why do cops need to walk around with leg holsters, with IBA's on, just to go serve a knock bench warrant for failure to appear for some petty misdemeanor.  
  
You're going to have to site this repeated claim.  I agreed with you before on this, but now I want evidence.  Then answer me this. Should police not take preventive measures to protect themselves from the actions/reactions of criminals?  
  
&gt; We need police. But this shit is going to far, and has been for a long time under the guise of ""protection"" the ""law"" and ""terrorism""  
  
Where did the bad police man in body armor touch you?  Do you think riot police that are having rocks and molotov cocktails thrown at them should be out in t-shits and shorts?  How about the 5 dead cops in Dallas? Do you think they, their families, friends, and community would have preferred appropriate body armor even when they were simply protecting an otherwise peaceful protest.  Getting ambushed during a situation like that seems like a good example why cops might dress like SWAT or special forces units when serving a warrant.  
  
In the end though, you're not comparing apples to apples.  You bitch and whine and complain about cops having work relevant protection.  Yet I don't hear or see you bitching like a liberal about road crews having bright orange vests.  
  
Why does the guy just holding a stop/slow sign need a vest and hard hat? They don't!!!!!11!!!!11!!!  - DTOMVet

DTOMVet,"&gt;Yes there are more dangerous, i.e. greater mortality rate, jobs than being a cop. The difference is that giving a gun to fisherman or a logger isn't going to save the fisherman from drowning or the logger from being crushed by a fall tree. The gun and body armor is going to save the cop though. 

Back to where we started. When you apply for these jobs you know what they entail. This is why military and police get honorable burials, parades, thank yous, and other entitlements. Considering all this, the rate at which they are injured with intentional agency, I.E shot during a high risk warrant no-knock is statistically 1 in several thousand. Literally this happens daily and everyone goes home on the police side.

&gt;You realize all job death statistics are like that. Any death while working is going to be counted in that professions mortality rate. Why should police mortality rates be calculated differently?

&gt;I've used that page as evidence for the murder rate of cops, so yes I'm aware of the wide range of causes of death. That page even reports the deaths of police dogs. 

You are screaming ""COPS JOBS ARE DANGEROUS"" and when its pointed out only 46 out of 1.1 million full time were killed intentionally, you bring this silly argument. All jobs consider al deaths while on the clock, but when you are a cop or soldier, slipping on ice and hitting your head on the ""Uncle Shuggs BBQ"" picnic table while on duty is not the same as being engaged in combat. 

&gt;Hi James Comey. I didn't realize you had a reddit account. What's the number of dead cops that you find unacceptable? And just FYI the ODMP site lists 135 cops died in 2017, 58 were murdered. 

You are one witty person. Oh, I'm sorry, 1.1 million cops, 135 died, 58 were intentionally killed. Of all the jobs in existence, this is still one of the safest jobs considering the duties. It's inarguable. If you are a cop the liklihood of you being injured day to day is 0.01%. This includes the 135 number. It simply isnt a dangerous job.

&gt;Would having body armor or a firearm help keep 1,100 roofers alive? Are they going to shoot gravity so that they don't fall to their death? Do you begrudge the roofer getting more advanced safety gear? Do you tell the logger he shouldn't have chainsaw resistant pants? 

Joe the fat fuck cop in Hilton Head doesn't need an IBA and a leg holsters to police his community. He doesnt need a big shiny 45. He doesnt need multi-pocket cargo pants, or big black boots. It's intimidation tactic plain and simple. Instead of making people feel comfortable around them, they impose fear. WHy not just stage the National guard around, you can hardly tell the difference.

The roofer? He only uses what is needed to get the job done, he doesnt wear his hard hat around just so people cant see he's a roofer and feel like a big guy.

&gt;That's not for you to decide. How many roofers were murdered on the job in 2017? The bureau of labor statistics says ZERO.

This is a pointless argument. We've been through this. Cop rate of being murdered is not even 1%. Hardly a tough job It is for me to decide. Sheriffs are voted in numb nuts. My sheriff WORKS FOR ME and the counties residents. No sheriff can justify owning such weaponary and vehicles. Either can you, all you've done is flipped hte burden onto me to prove they need it, instead of them and people like you who support them needing it. ONUS is on you pal.

&gt;Seeing as to how Bomb is a cause of death category on the ODMP site, I'd argue those vehicles are a good thing to have.

Bomb is not landmine, or I.E.D. Find me one incident that an MRAP or HUMVEE was used by local police due to that type of incident.I'll wait. In fact, we have robots for this. Wait, you mean we can just spend tax payer dollars on BOTH? And let it sit and rot because the fuel cost for one run is in the thousands of dollars. LOL FOOL.

&gt;You're going to have to site this repeated claim. I agreed with you before on this, but now I want evidence. Then answer me this. Should police not take preventive measures to protect themselves from the actions/reactions of criminals? 

Yes. This is what their gun, tazer, baton, pepper spray, and ultilities are for. None of them require tactical cargo pants with leg holsters or combat boots and vest with molly gear. Police were policing long before that shit became trendy so they can intimidate the populace.

&gt;Where did the bad police man in body armor touch you? Do you think riot police that are having rocks and molotov cocktails thrown at them should be out in t-shits and shorts? How about the 5 dead cops in Dallas? Do you think they, their families, friends, and community would have preferred appropriate body armor even when they were simply protecting an otherwise peaceful protest.

Why does the guy just holding a stop/slow sign need a vest and hard hat? They don't!!!!!11!!!!11!!! - DTOMVet

You are confusing different situations which require different tools. Everyday police do not need the full get-up. Those who are going to kick in a door for a violent fugitive do.

Just like a construction worker doesnt need a safety vest inside the building, he does when he's outside.

Each situation requires different gear. But your answer is ""POLICE IS THE SCARIEST JOB EVAR! 10,000 COPS DIE EACH MINUTE FROM MURDER!!!!! THE TOWN WITH 3 COPS SHOULD DRIVE AROUND MRAPS AND HOP OUT OF IT WITH COMBAT GEAR BECAUSE THERE COULD BE A BAD GUY!!!! DSTGDFSGSD  OH MY GAWWWWWD!

PEOPLE SHOULD KISS COPS DICKS AND FEET BECAUSE THEIR JOB IS HARD. DID YOU HEAR ME OTHER PEOPLE DON'T DIE ON THE JOB AT THE RATE OF 0.01% AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW MAN!""

You are cherry picking situations which either required some tactical gear respectively, like s riot, or where no gear at all would of saved them, like being shot while in the patrol car. The only fix to that is to up armor all vehicles, which wouldnt be very effective. I could out run an up armorered police car.

No one is saying there is no need for swat. There is no need for swat to go to a house in full get up, when a few deputies will suffice. But, then swat needs something to do you know. Cant just sit around after training for two weeks.

&gt;In the end though, you're not comparing apples to apples. You bitch and whine and complain about cops having work relevant protection. Yet I don't hear or see you bitching like a liberal about road crews having bright orange vests. 

Are you literally fucking retarded? You are comparing a construction worker wearing an GOVERNMENT mandated vest, rat line, hard hat, versus cops putting on gear that is NOT need for a particular situation. Like community policing.

Not all policing requires military ""grade"" or ""combat"" type gear.

But it certainly fucking makes more sense for a construction worker to have a flourescent vest on when doing traffic controll, then a cop in a small town pulling someone over for speeding 7 over the limit and have a fucking leg holster with combat boots, tactical cargo pants, and iba with molly.

jerbullfrog,"Well that’s globalism for ya I guess. Soros has money to fund the divide and conquer rhetoric, and useful idiots buy into it. Take Snapchat for example. Around the time Soros bought stock in Snapchat, suddenly they had Snapchat news, which was fake ass news, but it reached the masses. Propaganda by definition. So many young people are on Snapchat already, and then they see fake news telling them that Trump is a bad orange man, and by default, they believe it. 

Conservatives protest with their money. Boycotts are one way, but I don’t always go for that because I need my preferred goods too. I buy American as much as I can, but sometimes an American made alternative isn’t available.

My IQ has risen 10 fold. I'll be walking down the street and I get headaches because my head keeps hitting all the light posts on the sidewalk. Me and all of my other high IQ university college friends get together and we chant big orange man bad in a circle, and in harmony we become an unstoppable force of large IQ. In fact, the town renamed the entire street after our group after we made our 3000th Reddit comment about beating up fascists; though we've yet to ever find one. At the end of the day, my head is swollen from all the high IQ trump diss talk, I usually have to lay in bed because my head is too heavy to support my high IQ head.

Rogoverre,"Interesting point. But you can't make a law against being orange. You can't make a law that women have to go naked on Thursdays. You can't just make any old law.

The word ""Misdemeanor"" now means a low or small crime, but in Latin it just means acting badly. In this Constitutional context, the word may not mean what it means locally in court. It is a very general word here, and means (well to me) simply a bad act.

But whatever you think of the word ""misdemeanor"" there is no mistaking the word ""crime"" which is nailed higher by the adjective ""high."" 

You may have a point that the House can impeach because it wants to. The Senate, the elders, are there to decide if this is the real thing and the president should be removed. ""Senate"" means ""elder.""

I still maintain that impeachment, used so rarely, I think only once to the point of removing a president, is not a Parliamentary no-confidence vote and shouldn't be used as one. 

The last time it was used, the man really did something. It was decided it wasn't bad enough to remove him. No, it wasn't. 

This president hasn't actually done anything. 

So I am staying with my notion that there has to be a high crime involved. 

And I add that ""misdemeanor"" has to be kept to an older meaning, closer to the literal Latin.

This isn't a Parliamentary system. It was designed to have stability that Parliamentary systems don't have. I can't help noticing the results. This country has prospered with its slow-moving, stable, system. 

That may seem odd now as we are used to an electronic world where information and feelings change and move so quickly, instantly, 24 hours a day. 

But it's good and should be respected and kept.

I think one possible cause of GD is repressed homosexuality/femininity...kind of tricky for fathers because they usually want a man-ly son to play football or whatever with. Can't turn an orange into an apple though.

LilyBug123,"Have you been to the UK politics sub? It's loaded down with American hate.

The EU can be compared to a country where the EU members are like states in that country. 

Brexit is supported by those who remember what it was like before they were just another ""state"" obliged to follow laws made by someone else. They remember being powerful in their own right and having the most powerful country in the world as their best friend and ally. Their biggest issue was immigrants being forced on them. They don't like having to take it when the EU leaders actually seem to take pleasure in making Britain kneel just because they can. It makes the EU look small and nasty.

Anti-Brexit are the young people we would equate with our airhead liberal virtue signalers, who need to belong to a group. They feel secure the EU will always take care of them. Add the immigrants into the mix, who prefer that Britain be ordered to take more immigrants, whether they want them or not. 

Anti-Brexit people tend to be young and rule social media. They stamp their little feet and declare Trump a mean orange bad man. A protest during a Trump visit is considered great fun and all their friends will show up and do selfies. They listen to the BBC. They believe Trump is soon to be impeached and someone like Obama will be back in power to make the EU take them back. 

The mature America-supporters are silent as Trump supporters were. As a result 99% of what we hear is Trump hate, which translates directly into America hate. Pro Muslim views abound, with praise for Pakistani Sadiq Khan who supports protests against the president of the United States. They take the side of terrorists in talk of foreign policy. The propaganda media are doing a fine job of helping bring Britain to it's knees in subservience to the EU. The EU's actions and speech toward an ally of the US are a disgrace.

Maragret Sanger,  founded Planned parenthood. Racist AF. Talked about ridding society of the undisreables. The feeble minded and lower classes. Spoke at KKK rallies. Over 75% of abortion clinics are in minority communities. How all the injustices blacks have faced in this country (including slavery) they dont come close to planned parenthood. 16,000,000 black american human fetuses aborted. Why dont you tear down those monuments? Instead youre after Columbus. Atleast the spread of smallpox wasnt intentional. Natives gave us syphilis and tobacco. How many people have died from tobacco? Isnt it strange we never referred to the bubonic plague as asians genocide of europe? Their disease wiped out 1/3 of europe. I guess only the white man and west is to be blamed for the world turning. Interesting. Nevermind there is still slaves throughout the middle east, TODAY. And never mind that inconvenient hate fact that slavery was common practice and africans and muslims sold and used wayyy more slaves than the west ever did. A lot more brutal to boot. As bad as slavery was here, america only had 5% of the slaves and the slave life here was much better. At least they had value. They had to be shipped here after being kidnapped as war loot from conquering african tribes. Native americans had slaves too, numbnuts. Em, you are so brave and really went out on a limb being POLITICALLY CORRECT. What a rebel. 

What about gun control. You mentioned LV. Democrats created gun control to disarm free men/blacks. They went on to lynch almost 6,000 people (1,500 white republicans). All you do is rap about murder, torture and raping your own mother. Youre the epitome of a useful idiot. CNN's perfect viewer. You dont know what youre talking about. You entertain people. Youre a toy. 

You are worried about nuclear war? Fearmonger much? You spineless coward talking about your love for country as rocketman is shooting nukes over our allies heads and into our oceans.

 You spoke of Trump's orange hair. Not your most creative moment. ""The simpsons did it"" comes to mind. You spoke of taxes like this is something you have to even worry about like normal people do. You carry water for mainstream EVERYTHING with your rant. Johnson &amp; Johnson stock doubled overnight from peroxide sales, alone, after slim shady. Marshall Matters, you are the epitome of corporate livestock.  Thx to you, slim shady finally knocked the powdered wig off its throne as the worst hair cut in american history.  

What have you done to help Detroit? Besides give it a bad name and image, Mr. 8mile. It was the democrats who redlined around the now shithole you once called home. How have you used your immense wealth? By normalizing thuggery? Bill Clinton's 3 strikes law locked up a generation of fathers. This hurt the black community more than others. Children need discipline. They crave it and naturally seek it out. They also naturally yearn for protection. Without a father in their home they find it on a corner or in a gang and turn to thug culture for discipline, which you glorify. In fact, case in point. I will however give you credit for sticking around for your daughter. A crazy dysfunctional life, well documented by you, but you obviously love her. But Ike loved Tina as well, so...

bvw,"This era and world circumstance seems quite clearly to be the End Times last stage battle, the battle against the ""Eruv Rav"", the social deconstructionists in elite institutions allied with Amalkites (by philosophical inheritance), and the last bad behaviours of the Ismaelites (Islam).   After this era, it's Messianic.  Is Donald Trump the leader of the froces of good?  Is Putin?  Or will both or either flame out, before that.   

It is held by some that Obama could have been the man to redeem the Ismaelites, to cause Islam to regret being the enemies of Israel, to repent and changes themselves into true warriors for Peace.  To do that they'd have to abandon the Temple Mount, and also abandon the uncessing and increasing violence, and put down those leaders in them who preach violence.  Saudi would have to open its borders to Jews  and even would be good to help fund the rebuilding of the Jewish State, Israel. 

President Trump is on his way to Israel.  What will he actuall come to proclaim there?

I wrote at the Jerusalem post an anon post as ""orange quill"" with a take on it.  The key take away is this: 

""This is like President Trump coming to Jerusalem.  Not that he is a wild boar.    Nor is he a vacationer.  But it is 100% sure that ""The Authorities"", that is a singular ""The Authority"" acting in manifold ways, will arrive with him and deal properly and satisfactorily with whatever his actions and those with him, present.""    

A deep awesome respect and fear of G-d, the Creator who continually acts through the Laws of Nature as its G-d, and his Divine Providence in carrying out His G-dly Will, infused our American Founders.  This is clear in George Washington's words, especially in his First Inaugural Address.  It is clear in the words of John Jay, our First Chief Justice.  It is absolutely stunning in the words of the Declaration of Independence.

But something happened, men are men, by the era of the great man, Lincoln, in his First Inaugural, the ""Will of the People"", had become equal to that of the Divine, if not more primary.  And President Trump's words about G-d and G-d's Will, have been like Lincoln's: great, but not trancendental like Washington's.     

What brings troubles?   Here on T_D, on Reddit, or in the world?  Only G-d's allowance for them to happen and produce harmful effect.  And thay is only so as to make those impacted ""Woke"".

Will President Trump keep his heartfelt promise to move our Embassy to Jerusalem, to recognize in full formality as a nation that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel, that all Israel is Israel.

Now, when you work with kids, you learn his to determine if they are voicing their own opinion or just parroting. I could hear her mom say that plain as day. I asked her why she mentioned his skin color. I asked her if she would want somebody to say, ""that brown girl is bad.""  Then, I asked her what he did she thought was bad. I told her if she didn't know him, she shouldn't make judgments. We talked about being open to new people, and about the golden rule.  I told her I didn't know President Trump either, but I wish I did, because it would be cool to know a person from TV. I told her that since I didn't know him, I would treat him like I treat any President or Chief---with respect. 

At no time did I tell her what I thought about him as a person, tell her her mother was wrong, or expose her to politics. I just have her the tools to think for herself. That should be every teacher's responsibility.",2017-05-17,1,The_Donald

Ugh I didn't know about any of this, it sucks when celebs you like ""get involved"" in politics. Most rappers when they talk about Trump they sound real real ignorant (Busta Rhymes at the Grammys) Snoops mad about the travel ban. lol ok but why? It was the premise of the stupid video, oh you banned immigrants, I guess next is gangsta dogs like me that he'll want to ban. WTF


&gt;him winning the presidency; police being able to kill motherf--kers


He won the presidency, why you mad though? What do police killings have to do with Trump lol seems to me they are down this year so far anyways


&gt;people being in jail for weed for 20, 30 years and motherf--kers that’s not black on the streets making money off of it 

This has got absolutely nothing to do with Trump either LOL. It's real bad in the rap/black and mexican communities there literally almost no opposing viewpoints it's just one big echo chamber no one calls out anything they all just repeat what's wrong with Trump while at the same time they admit they don't know about no American politics, they just know the orange man is bad smh",2017-03-14,3,The_Donald

Liberals have always hated this man for one reason and one reason only, and it's not any of the reasons they keep peddling: They're terrified of another, smarter, richer, more effective and more ruthless Reagan who will get more baked into the culture the longer he sticks around. 

They're terrified of an Uber-Reagan II -- that comes equipped with laser beams, photon torpedoes, trans-warp drive, a Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" soundtrack and a Twitter account... and a smash mouth (a big one) -- who could be more effective than Reagan ever was with longer lasting effects and music you can dance to. A guy who doesn't need political consultants because he's already mind-melded with at least 40% of the population (and gunning for a chunk of the other 60%).

It's why they're so desperate to stop or slow or sabotage the guy before his feet even touch the Oval Office. It's also why they and their friends at Reddit are busy doing silly things like downvoting our posts and comments here, as if they can suppress the truth.

Just take whatever they accuse him of, rotate 180 degrees and translate from lib-robospeak to truth:

1) ""he's racist"" = ""crap, he could bring back MLK's dream that race shouldn't matter, get more blacks into thinking, 'hey, we all Americans, yo' and grab a huge chunk of the black vote. Oh, he's a big fan of inner-city K-12 school choice and charter schools, too? You say he's making Devos his Secretary of Education??!!! Son of a... !""

2) ""he's a misogynist"" = ""crap, he's got women all over his leadership team, the head of his campaign team was a woman (she said ""the people say No, no no Romney for Secretary of State!!"" and he said, ""well, ok then, but lemme finish neutering him""), his most frequent spokespeople are women (including his campaign chief), all the women in his family adore him and he seems to get along with women everywhere, including his ex's. He loves women (and boy do they love him). Women love strength, confidence, direction and, yes, bad boys. You ever look at the facial expressions of the women standing behind him at his rallies? It's called bliss. Crap, he'll get even more of the woman vote next time""

3) ""he's a bumbling idiot"" = ""crap, he's a genius who knows exactly what he's doing and is always at least one step ahead of us across at least 4 different fronts on 4 different levels... and that's just when he's taking a breather on Sundays.""

4) ""he's a thin-skinned warmonger"" = ""crap, he's a peace through strength guy. That orange-wigged bastard might bring about the best relations ever with Russia, put China in check, pull us out of Middle East cesspools and win the nobel prize... and actually deserve it""

5) ""He's a dictator in the making, a threat to the Republic"" = ""He's **the leader of the Rebellion against our Evil Empire,** a freaking Luke Skywalker, and he could be the most Constitutionally-minded public servant America's had in decades. He wants to *restore* the Republic. The force is strong with this one, damnit.""

6) ""Trump will self-destruct"" = ""we're screwed""

It's called projection: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection

Rather than self-reflect they deflect and deflection doesnt work in the Internet age where thousands are ready to pick bull***t apart from 100 different angles 24/7, including Sundays.

cultural_dissenter,"&gt; Marriage, in basic and legal terms, is a contract with the sole purpose of having and raising kids.

It's not the sole purpose by any means.  As a secular institution, it also serves the role of handling inheritance, and ensuring that families are financially co-dependent, rather than being dependent on the government.

My wife and I are legally married, and have been now for most of a decade.  We are going through the process of adoption.  We can't have biological children, but I couldn't have biological children with a man, either.  We are legally responsible to each other, and will be legally responsible for the raising of our child.  That fills the government interest in the legal institution of marriage.

&gt; Homosexual couples don't have the need for this kind of contract because that's not the reason they marry

To support each other, to covenant with each other, and to bring up the next generation together, ensuring that our children have a home, and that should one of us shirk this duty that there is a legal obligation to support our spouse, and our children?

It's why I married, and why my sisters married their husbands.

&gt;  most would be happy with calling it with another name.

The very reason you want to call it another name is because you want to other it.  It's the very reason that most of us aren't interested in having it by another name.  What I want is the same rights and responsibilities to the same secular institution, for the same reason. If you want to have something else for religious reasons, create your own institution.  Let's get the church out of marriage, rather than the government, since it's a secular institution pre-dating any modern religion.

&gt; Then, why does this LOBBY push for calling apples oranges? 

Why do you insist on calling apples oranges?  I'm married for the same reasons my sisters are (apples), and you're the one trying to call my marriage an orange.

&gt; This is because society found out that raising kids has an economic cost that make the families with kids less competitive, desincentivizing it.

Yes, kids are expensive.  We know - there are lots of gay parents.

&gt; But, because having and raising kids is crucial for the survival of the society, some changes had to be applied in the form of tax cuts so that according to game theory having kids is not punished.

That would be nice, but it's not why I married my wife.  These days, we live in Canada (but are still taxed in the US, too), so I get almost no tax advantages for marriage at all.  They don't have a ""filing jointly"" status.

&gt; The lobby pushes for ""marriage"" in legal terms despite not fulfilling the most basic criteria,

The basic criteria are that you have a pulse and aren't married to anyone else.  Vegas marriages, marriages of convenience, marriages for immigration purposes, marriages by infertile people (like me), marriages by post-menopausal women, etc.  

It's not the government's job to mandate that you have biological children - if they wanted to do that, then they would make it a precondition of marriage.  It's not, and never has been, if for no reason other than it's better for children to be born in wedlock, and that only happens if you let people without children marry.  The moment you do that, though, you have people marrying who will never have kids, which is irrelevant for gay people given how many do have biological children and raise them.

&gt; Calling unequal things equal, specifically in legal terms, is inherently unfair.

Indeed.  That's why we fight people like you who want to take two identical married couples, with the same qualifications, and call one a marriage and one a civil union.

&gt; Laws shouldn't be written to favour one group, they should be written to favour society

Exactly!  Marriage is a civil contract, and it's unfair to favour religious bigots who feel that their particular narrow worldview should be law.

&gt;  this one is bad because it sends the message that changing the meaning of words and interpretation of laws in the benefit of lobbies for political gain is ok.

What's bad is not following the constitution, which requires that the government provide equal protection under the law to all, rather than playing favourites.  If I marry Jane Doe, my marriage isn't recognized.  If a man does, it is.  That is not equal protection under the law, and thus it violates the constitution.

&gt; Opposing the BAD IMPLEMENTATION does not mean being against the IDEA, but the propaganda always misconstrues this argument because they know they cannot win otherwise.

There's only one good implementation, and that's to quit artificially limiting who can get civilly married.  The government treats everyone equally, and since there is not (and has never been) a requirement to have or want children, that means just marrying whoever shows up, like they do now.  Churches are free to marry (or not marry) whomever they want, and we all go on and live our lives.

If the government wants to incentivize raising children, that's easy enough to do.  Limit the tax breaks to couples raising children.  Gay, straight, adopted, biological - the goal is to support the children, and we have no choice who our parents are.

&gt;  that's not what the lobby wants.

I'm part of that lobby.  I'm was one of the people fighting for marriage equality, and I was working on getting standing for a lawsuit to change the laws.  Someone beat us to it, but I can tell you what **I** fight for, and that's genuine equality.  My family, now and after we adopt, is no less - and no more - than any other.",2016-10-31,1,The_Donald

Then when I encountered Hillary supporters who couldn't establish an argument against Trump other than ""we can't let the bad man win"" it just solidified my support even more. I suspect there are a lot of people that are at some stage along this path now just waiting to come over.",2016-10-25,90,The_Donald

The only way they could have pulled this scam off is if they had instructed the press to treat Trump fair and square for the last year and a half, only to drop this attack on him from out of nowhere. Instead they threw away their credibility for sixteen months shouting KKK Hitler racist bigot xenophobe incest con man orange skin bankrupt taxes Nazi frog small hands Russian spy who wants to nuke Putin.

skillDOTbuild,"[The best pad thai in the world is near Soi Khao San](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d1129308-Reviews-Thip_Samai-Bangkok.html). I don't know how it has a 4/5 star rating. Idiots! It's the best. Also order orange juice. Worth the wait and the line moves fast. It's open till about 3-4 am, I believe.

You could also check out the new Emquartier mall...near the old Emporium mall. I know malls and shopping are kind of lame, but it's semi-interesting to see how much better Thai malls are than American malls. 

There is a very large Japanese community in Thailand. That means there is some great ramen. [This is my favorite and it's absolutely delicious.](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d1148079-Reviews-Bankara_Ramen_The_Manor-Bangkok.html) Can't go wrong!  

You should absolutely go to tallest outdoor bar in the world...on top of a skyscraper. Just tell the taxi driver or Uber (better) to take you to Lebua Sky Bar. Another great skyscraper bar (less high) that's a little more chill and very nice is at Hotel Muse. Just have a taxi take you to Muse Hotel on Soi Langsuan (soy long-soo-ahn).

I recommend taking motorcycle taxis if you're by yourself. Anybody wearing an orange vest standing next to a group of other dudes with orange vests and motorcycles will take you anywhere you need to go. Best to go somewhere close by. Give them like 100 baht at the end of your ride and wait for change. If they ask for more, you would have to have gone pretty far. 

Also, a lot of the taxi drivers and motorcycle drivers might be particularly scammy/high-priced around Soi Khao San. #NotAll

If you fancy hanging out with Muslims, you can go to Nana at night and be amazed as Muslims from all around the world eat kebab and talk to prostitutes (red light district). Soi Nana has two sides...one w/ a lot of Muslims, the other side with the infidels. 

Anyways, it's interesting just to see. You can eat kebab and stuff. There's persian food and stuff...but it's highly pricey when the taste isn't so great. Still, if that doesn't bother you, it's interesting just to sit down and eat. 

If you feel like having a ""fancy"" dinner or Italian food, I can't recommend [Il Bolegnese](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d3139672-Reviews-Il_Bolognese-Bangkok.html) highly enough. There are a fair number of Italians living in BKK and it's like eating in Italy. You can't go wrong with anything. Outstanding!

Also, [Gaggan](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d1946121-Reviews-GAGGAN-Bangkok.html) off of Soi Langsuan is another decent, semi-pricey option. Very near the Muse Hotel/bar.  

Sadly, I can't really give you details re: the best Thai noodle shops and duck rice places and the like. Because most of them aren't online or they're in Thai. Most places tend to specialize in a certain kind of dish (chicken and rice, for example), and some places make way better versions of that dish than other places that specialize in it. 

All the food you see on the street is likely not that good. The best places are the open air shops with stools and no windows, but actual tables. That said, some of the street food is good. Don't get me wrong. But there's a shitload of it and most of what you'll find are more or less snacks, not lunch (not noodles). 

I would avoid the noodle places that set up tables outside than break down everything after a certain hour. The best noodle/rice places all have their own shops (shophouses) that have been around forever. That's not to say the noodles at all shophouses are good either. You really have to know the place if you want the best example of something. But, if it's the first time you've been there, it all kind of tastes good anyways. It's just some places have AMAZING noodles whereas *most* places have okay noodles. 

Actually, if you want to try some of the best dishes (noodles/rice/great thai food), look at Austin Bush's Blog. [He has Google Maps pins attached to every place he reviews.](http://www.austinbushphotography.com/blog/maps.html) He knows his shit more than almost anyone. Check out his blog's Bangkok posts. Look for stuff photos where stuff looks tasty. Than go there, if nearby. 

One problem w/ being a tourist in Bangkok is you have to sort of plan out what you're going to do in advance. Since you're not sure where shit is, and it's easy to be in traffic for two hours. You don't want to want to go to one place on one side of town, with plans to go to the opposite side of town an hour later. This is obvious, though. 

Also, if you like golf, driving ranges in Bangkok are badass! And cheap! You can probably rent clubs (call and ask). [This place is perfect](http://www.bangkok-nightlife.net/golf/42-tee-off-driving-range.html). Also, their food is great. It's fun to order some food/drink beer and hit range balls for about $2/tray. It's also fairly near Ramen Bankara. Kind of. 

Oh, you don't want to miss this place either. [Amazing Hong Kong noodles!](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293916-d8240748-r278232239-Gokfayuen-Bangkok.html) It's in Thonglor...there are a decent amount of bars in Thonglor. Not a bad idea to go to the range, then to that noodle place, then to a club in Ekamai called Escobar. All close by. 

If you like good coffee, on the weekends [Roots](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d5600541-Reviews-Roots_Coffee_Roaster-Bangkok.html) is open. It's in Ekamai (looks like it's right by in Thonglor now). Anyways, great coffee...just as good as Intelligentsia and Stumptown. Try their espresso. Best I've ever had. There are all kinds of great coffee places now. I think Bangkok ranks as one of the top 10 cities in the world for coffee now. All the rich kids are into coffee and started up shops/bought $10k+ espresso machines and sell coffee for $1-3. 

If you're getting traditional thai coffee or thai tea on the street and don't want sugar in it, say ""[drink name...gafe for coffee and cha for tea] mai ow yen kaap"".  

Also, if you want to say yes, say ""chai kaap"" if you're a man or ""chai ka"" if you're a woman. End all your sentences with kaap or ka for the most part and you'll seem polite :)",2016-09-23,1,The_Donald
BMCossey,"I do understand it. The fire that destroyed army records at the national personnel records center in 1973 has plagued many families over the years, to include mine. That fire destroyed my grandfathers service records for WWII and Korea, to include several medals for valor, heroism, and his Purple Heart. The only proof we have of his Purple Heart is the actual medal. My fathers Vietnam records were destroyed. Every time my father was saturated for weeks at a time in agent orange or agent blue he went to doc when returned back from field to document it. I don't know how many lives he took in Vietnam, but it is clear today the damage has been done. He watched good friends (one friend died in his arms) and fellow warriors die horrible deaths. I do not like to make post traumatic stress claims bc I know for fact many who claim it are liars and that takes away from people like my father who were put in a situation (caught the draft) where at times had to kill with his bayonet. Bc of these false claims and destruction of military personnel records my father has been fighting the VA for a decade now trying to get disability for PTS and effects of agent orange saturation. I myself am ~75% def in left ear due to hot fueling operations with thousands of uh-60's (Blackhawk), ah-60's (attack version Blackhawk), ah-64's (Apache), ch-53 (sea stallions, to be fair only fueled a handful of times. I think pilots were training), ch-47 (chinook, also only handful times.) I don't want any disability for my hearing bc I'm fine, I live my life just as I want to and would rather the 10% disability I could get to go to people like my father or operators like her son who have real combat exp who have killed and watched good men die. I watched a documentary few years back about how Vietnam is doing now after 20,000,000 gal of agent orange and the people of Vietnam are suffering so bad. 3rd generation children are being born with MASSIVE birth defects, extra limbs in places, missing limbs, extra or missing stuff in general. 2nd generation children had normal levels of birth defects, oddly enough. So if I have kids, they would 3rd gen from my father and have a higher chance of crazy birth defects, which unfortunately makes the child having decision really easy for me: the family name dies with me. Wew lad, this got log. Anyways man I have said it before and will continue to say it everyday, THANK YOU for your selfless service. This must reach all corners of the 'dark' places of the Internet.

Teebuttah,"Donald Trump held a peaceful rally in San Jose, California.  After the rally, protestors showed up with eggs and started throwing eggs, water bottles, and other food and garbage at the rally-goers exiting the rally.  A smiling blonde woman was recorded backed up against a wall and being pelted in the face with eggs by a mob of screaming anti-Trump protestors.  

This is considered assault.  And although news outlets attempted to say she taunted them to rile them up, they ignored the fact that the protesters came prepared with eggs, which proves the assault was pre-meditated.

Meanwhile, the police can be seen in the background standing around and doing nothing to help the woman or control the crowd.  It was later revealed San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo had told them to stand down and not intervene.  For 90 minutes, officers stood and watched while protestors, emboldened by the lack of police intervention, grew increasingly violent against people who were leaving the rally.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4mbkh8/retard_bernie_terrorists_mistake_one_of_their_own/d3u6cns) is a compilation for some of the violence that occurred that day.

Basically, there was an obstruction of the door in the convention center leading to the parking complex, so rally-goers were forced to go around the block.  As they left the convention center, the rally crowd thinned out, as some decided to go eat or hang out in San Jose.  Those who continued to go to the parking complex were met with a wall of protestors.  The rally-goers did not appear to want to engage with the protestors.  They seemed like they just wanted to go to the parking lot.  Then the protestors attacked, and will henceforth be referred to as rioters.

A man was assaulted from the back by a rioter with a bag of rocks.  His ear was split open and blood covered the side of his face.  This can be considered attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon.  Again, officers stood on the background and watched.

Rioters threw a metal street barricade at someone's head, and an orange traffic cone at another's head.  More blood.

Another man was sucker punched from behind and knocked out cold.  Rioters ran up to kick his unresponsive body.

A young teenager was chased down the street by a rioter while the crowd chanted ""kill him!""  He was eventually tackled to the ground by the rioter, who later bragged about it on Facebook.

Another man was beaten by a crowd, until someone in the crowd realized he was also a member of the protest.  The guy yelled ""stop, he's one of us!"" They stopped the beating and the crowd started chanting ""Bernie!  Bernie!""  If the man were a rally-goer, they would have continued to beat him.

In many of these scenes, the police can be seen in the background doing nothing while rally-goers were assaulted, brutalized, and bloodied.

Tom Llamas, a reporter assigned to the campaign and outspoken critic of Trump, was on the scene.  He described the riot as the bloodiest he had witnessed so far.

A reporter who was streaming on periscope was seen meeting up with another reporter who told her in a frightened tone, ""this is bad.  I just saw a man get knocked out cold and people ran up to him and kicked his body.  I called 911 and reported the incident but they put me on hold, I shit you not.  I then approached an officer standing on the perimeter and told him what happened and he said he couldn't do anything.""  (Paraphrased.)

When rally-goers finally got to their cars, their cars were swarmed.  Videos show rioters jumping on cars, smashing their windows, and kicking and shattering their tail-lights.

These and other incidences of violence were allowed to occur for 90 minutes after the rally ended.

Mayor Liccardo released a statement that the violence -- **the violence he himself condoned and allowed to happen** -- shows Donald Trump that he is not welcome in San Jose.  He then blames the violence on Trump's rhetoric, while absolving himself completely of blame.

The next day, thousands of people took to Mayor Liccardo's [Facebook](https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=616739211810148&amp;id=205510299599710) and Twitter demanding an explanation for the violence.  Mayor Liccardo issued two more statements condemning the violence, but ultimately blaming Trump.  The San Jose police chief released a statement defending his command of the officers to stand down, explaining that having the officers intervene would lead to more violence.  (How?  Who knows?)

The media paid very little attention to the riot in San Jose.  There is ongoing outage at the situation.  The victims of San Jose are planning to sue the city for not protecting them.

TLDR: Trump rally lets out, violence occurs from anti-Trump rioters, the mayor allowed the violence to happen, then blamed it on Trump.  Basically, if you have any interest in watching a speech given by someone whose politics differ from those of the mayor's, you're not welcome in San Jose.  And if you dare to step foot in San Jose, he wouldn't mind if you bled or died to send the message that people like you are not welcome in his city.  And then he would blame your death on Trump.

Aurelius_Junianus,"&gt; 1- Trump could make Clinton’s unfavorable ratings worse, which will be easy once Trump concentrates on her in the general election. 

[Clinton's homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L5hn5B8TYI) and other forms of wealth, Democrats will try to be the lower class's candidate.  Judo, and watch as it becomes *crooked rich* versus *honest magnate* with most feeling confused and then open to new ideas.

&gt; 2- Trump could improve his own favorability by being more “presidential” for a few months so he doesn’t look so crazy.

His family does this for him, I hope gaffes between Clinton mother and daughter help Trump.  ""Chelsea's DNA not a match to Bill's"" would be hilarious to watch come out during a debate.

&gt; 3- Trump can sell the “two Trumps” story (while simultaneously denying it) until you start recognizing his campaign behavior as strategy, not insanity. That sale is underway now.

/r/The_Donald is already sold on this, public versus personal.  We adore the personal and respect the public face.

&gt; 4- Clinton’s health could be such an issue by November that she no longer looks like a viable option. That’s at least a 50% likelihood in my opinion. (Part of a hypnotist’s skill set involves detecting “tells” for health issues. Clinton looks deeply unhealthy to me.)

Heart and soul, she should not be given the office

&gt; 5- Trump could name a VP that makes Trump seem less scary. That seems like a near certainty.

I want [this man](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/election/2016/04/29/mattis-no-presidential-run/83707962/), Obama fired him and his job was Iraq and surroundings.  Less scary is less important than more noble

&gt; 6- Clinton’s server scandal could turn into an indictment. Or worse, it could appear as if the indictment is being delayed for political reasons. That plays into Trump’s “rigged system” narrative. He wins either way (in typical Trump fashion.)

I'm a superstitious man, I think the FBI is going to wait for the next president and let the American people decide.  I wish their evidence could seep out, Trump would see justice and put Hillary in Jail.

&gt; 7- Trump could win Sanders supporters (young people) by coming out in favor of legal weed and inexpensive or free college. Add some support for universal healthcare (better than Obamacare), some job promises, and you’re almost there.

Scott's wrong here, the democrats will destroy themselves, **MATCH ME, MATCH ME** will go to Clinton's funding.  It will be handled poorly and Bernie voters will riot and make devil's pacts with /r/The_Donald at the least.

&gt; 8- Trump has already improved his haircut. The color is no longer orange and the cut is much better. Humans are visual creatures, and that old haircut probably accounted for about 10 points of his 70% unfavorable rating. The new look is probably already having a small effect.

Visual voters are not worth my time, memes will rule them more every year and kek the frog god will lead us to a great future.  Keket the snake god (you cannot make this stuff up, folks) brings false enlightenment of popular misconceptions that obscure and render unknown the truth.  Meme magic from one of the first civilizations to now.

&gt; 9- Trump can move to the middle on his most aggressive policies. Expect to hear more about how the deported illegal immigrants can easily get back into the country via legal means. And remember my prediction that we will temporarily call U.S. Post Offices Mexican Embassies so the illegals can “deport” themselves just by going to the Post Office and filling out some forms. That is technical deportation (because an Embassy is foreign territory) but no one is worse off for it.

Give them priority queue for coming back if they're useful according to rules that that are clear but also misinterpretable, and watch the majority fuck themselves while the few useful are actually helped.

&gt; 10- The Syrian refugee crisis could spawn more terror attacks in Europe, or more rape stories. That seems likely. A few days ago, Germany’s chancellor, Merkel, came out in favor of refugee “safe zones” in Syria. That was Trump’s idea months ago. Everyone scoffed. Watch as Trump’s “crazy talk” from months ago turns into policy before your eyes.

Insulting over other issues and then knowing the value of walking away from a bad deal gets results, Trump knows when to use this masterfully.

&gt; 11- Trump can prove he’s not a racist. That’s easy. All he needs to do is hug a bunch of non-white folks on camera. Real racists don’t hug the ones they dislike. They just don’t. 

Trump isn't racist, Gamergate isn't sexist, and the MSM isn't smart to become the Lügenpresse for no good reason.

&gt; 12- Trump can push “love” over hate. As I predicted some time ago, he is already saying love, love, love. This persuasion will take lots of time and repetition to have an impact, but Trump has time, and he controls the rate of repetition.

You lock your door because you love those inside, the wall came from love of America.  MSM again.

&gt; 13- As long as Cruz and Kasich are in the race, our minds allow us to imagine an alternative to Trump that is some sort of magical unicorn of goodness. Our brains are conflating all the non-Trump Republicans (including Romney and Ryan) into some sort of imaginary “other” that has qualities we like. Likewise, on the Democrat side, your brain is combining Clinton and Sanders as one conflated Democrat option. And Bernie brings some good qualities to that imaginary creature (such as the appearance of honesty).

Florida is an interesting state.  I've lived in Miami (school), and spent a good amount of time on the Treasure Coast, and visited Tampa.  [I would say this map gives a pretty good base on the state](https://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr05/2013/4/17/11/enhanced-buzz-16020-1366213115-14.jpg).   I actually like Florida!

Miami is fun, but only really if you have a decent amount of cash -- 6 figure salary.  I describe the place as ""better at being LA then LA"", both good and bad.  Our women are hotter, and we are better at driving supercars all day long.  It's the only place I've ever been where I've seen billboards for plastic surgery.  

Which reminds me.  In a lot of parts of Florida, you see [billboards for vasectomies](https://www.vasweb.com/Vasectomy_Billboards_Florida.html) (link SAFE for work, link to Doug Stein's Billboard page), because of old people.  Once you cross into Miami-Dade County, the opposite is the case -- billboards for testosterone treatment, ""Brazillian Butt Lifts"", boob jobs, nose jobs, etc.  Additionally, when you cross into Miami-Dade County, culture becomes español.  We have some jokes on this -- ""The United States ends at the Miami-Dade/Broward County [Ft. Lauderdale] line.  South of there is North Cuba"".  We've also said ""Ft. Lauderdale is where we go when we want to have a vacation in America.""

Florida can be fun.  Miami is party central, and is a pretty full-fledged city now.  It's becoming more cosmopolitan there -- they have decent theater and concerts now, where the Arsht Center is the second largest theater complex in the US after Lincoln Center in New York.  Ultra Music Festival is an annual event that draws many in.  Miami is rough for people under 21, but once I turned 21, Miami was a lot of fun.  Just don't be poor there.  Miami-Dade has the second highest wealth inequality of major counties in the US -- after New York county, New York (Manhattan).  Work and salaries are fairly limited, and the rent is too damned high, but not as bad as in a lot of other places -- I can recall paying $1800/mo for a furnished 1/1 on a high floor (upper 20s) including parking in a fancy building in Brickell.  Brickell is nicknamed the ""Manhattan-of-the-South"", due to the number of high rises, and is one of the densest neighborhoods in the state.  Miami suburbs are tough, and generally, it's expensive or it's got a lot of crime/undesirable.  Places like Coral Gables, Aventura, and Pinecrest are expensive, and are older.  Other areas are newer, and some are downright crappy.  Places like Goulds are fairly lousy.  Homestead has a fair amount of rednecks (although they do speak English, which is rare in a lot of parts of the Miami area).  Hialeah is a quite different beast -- don't move there if you don't speak Spanish.  Doral is another nice suburb.  The Donald has a golf resort there, and it is home to some fairly nice houses, but it is also home to Dade county's garbage incinerator. 

Life in Miami-Dade county is not without it's problems.  Skilled work is limited, especially in my field (tech...hence why I'm in Seattle...), and salaries don't seem to well reflect the cost of living.  The incomes in Dade are fairly low, especially compared to the cost of living.  A good chunk of this may be spillover from the Mariel Boatlift (caused cheap labor), and subsequent white flight (moved to Broward and Palm Beach).  Mass transit is limited, and everyone drives.  There are a number of toll roads, but there are a lack of controlled access roads that run east and west.  This is a county with 3 million people, and only three freeways traverse across it (the Turnpike, which is practically in Broward, doesn't get a lot of traffic, the Palmetto Expressway (FL-826), which is also fairly far north, and the Dolphin Expressway (FL-836, tolled), which heads west from around downtown Miami).  This results in a massive amount of traffic on roads controlled by traffic lights, which cause massive delays.  The drivers are often distracted, and passing a Florida driving test is trivial (test in parking lot).  Although this doesn't seem to matter -- in Dade, if memory serves, 25% of drivers are uninsured, and 25% don't have a license, and these percentages are neither the entirely same people nor mutually exclusive.  In general, Miami can be fun, but you may need to have money already / a job some place else, potentially a long commute, habla español, and the place is quite hectic in general.

The keys are also an extension of party central, but in a different wayThey drink until morning in Key West, and there is a great amount of beach bummery -- people are pretty lackadaisical about work, with the exception of military.  There, if you show up to work more than two or three days a week, your considered a reliable employee! Other areas of the keys are more chill, great places to fish and dive.  You spend a lot of time driving up US-1 if you live there, I'd imagine, and things are fairly expensive.  There are no Wal-Marts or Costcos in the keys, and a trip to these places requires a trip up to the mainland (about 125 miles).  I'd actually love to live in Key West for a bit.  Marathon, Florida (in the middle keys) is the hottest place in the 50 states on a year-round average, with Key West not far behind.  If you like the warmth, and hate the cold, and San Diego's winter is too cold, the Keys may be worth a look, but they're a bit isolated.

Panama City (in the panhandle) is considered another party area, but it's a lousy place.  It's a place where college kids Spring Break, kinda crap.  I wouldn't recommend it. 

I've enjoyed spending time in the Tampa area.  Everything seems to be relatively nice.  Lots of blonde women around.  People seem reasonably relaxed.  Real estate is reasonable, there is a good amount of work in the area.  Everything seems a lot more civilized then Miami.  I've not lived there, but I have some friends who have, and they enjoyed it, but it might be a bit relaxed for my taste.

Naples and Marco Island in southwest Florida are nice places, but mostly for old rich people to live/retire to/vacation.  Sarasota is a little bit more built up, but somewhat similar.

The Space Coast (Brevard County, which contains Cocoa Beach), and the Treasure Coast (Port St Lucie, Vero Beach) are a bit more mixed, but not so much is going on.  I wouldn't recommend it, unless you're retired.  Things generally work well, although [there's an incredible amount of stupid crimes that come out of the Treasure Coast](http://offthebeat.blogs.tcpalm.com/).

The Orlando area is a nice place to visit, but not a great place to live.  I've not lived there, but I know some people who have.  They said it did indeed live up to it's stereotype as being ""the minimum wage capital of the world"".  They also said people didn't seem to do much.  They went to the theme parks a lot -- everyone has a Universal annual pass, many have Disney annual passes.  (Disney sells a Florida Residents a special annual pass that only allows access to Epcot after 4PM to allow use of the restaurants by locals, in addition to regular annual passes).  There is a fair amount of business in this area.  Tupperware is headquartered on Orange Blossom Trail, and a huge amount of business regarding the travel industry, especially rental cars, is handled in Orlando. 

Most of the middle of Florida is empty -- extremely so.  It's the only place in North America where you can drive nearly 50 miles without seeing a highway exit.  A fair amount of trash and rednecks exist in the rest of the middle of Florida (not Orlando).

Since we are on The_Donald, this discussion wouldn't be complete without discussing politics.  Florida is a swing state (duh).  The Tri-Counties, which refer to Miami-Dade, Broward (Ft. Lauderdale), and Palm Beach counties are extremely liberal.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz represents Broward.  Last I checked, if these three counties were their own state, they would be as liberal as Vermont.  Other areas tend to go red, as does the Cuban population of Miami (but not other people).

The stupid crimes/Florida Man thing is a bit interesting, and a bit misleading.  While it does seem like there are a lot of crimes, it is worth noting that it is difficult to tell if there are more crimes in Florida than anywhere else, as **Florida has an unusual law that makes all police books public,** and reporters troll them for funny, stupid, and interesting affidavits.  **This is what leads to Florida Man!**  Granted, I do have a hypothesis that there are actually a lot of crimes and stupidity in Florida, coming from a combination of the diversity -- you mix rednecks that pick oranges, Cubans, New Yawkers, Michganders, Chicagoans, white trash, and people on vacation, in a place where it's hot all the time, and the education system is...sub-optimal, but far from the worst, you do get people being stupid.

**To sum up your questions about Florida,** in places like Miami and Ft. Lauderdale, the dating/sex is great, and it's a lot of fun.  There are huge bugs.  A lot of people aren't the brightest.  Politics are weird.  But it's tough without money, and work opportunities in a lot of cases are limited, and this seems to be a problem for the state.  Florida is considered to not have any manufacturing for the most part, and has a heavily service-oriented economy.  To top it off, we also have great business and asset protection laws.  I like it, but don't want to be there full time.

Rubalag,"Ah, the mask has fallen. A wise man once said ""don't pay much attention to *what* people say, but rather to *why* they say it"". All the history that you brought up in order to prove your point that ""culture is always changing"" was only there in service of your own loathing and contempt for racists and xenophobes. Any white person who even betrays a *hint* of pride in his history or solidarity with his race is automatically a ""vile racist stormfronter piece of shit"" who deserves nothing more than social ostracism, scorn, and contempt. You are using facts in service of emotions, not in service of truth. That makes you *exactly* part of the problem that Niekisch was talking about.

Now if I am to engage your original post on a factual level at all it is only to tell you this: you have committed two basic fallacies. 

The first fallacy is known as an “appeal to nature”. This fallacy consists of claiming that something is good because something is natural. In your case, you are claiming that cultural change is good because it is natural for cultures to change over time. This argument can easily be shown to be ridiculous. For example, warfare has also been a natural state of affairs since time immemorial -- does that make warfare a good thing? Obviously not. Of course, cultural change is not *necessarily* a bad thing, but whether or not a *particular* cultural change is good or bad should be evaluated on its own merits and not by using fallacious arguments.

The second fallacy is known as the “continuum fallacy”. This fallacy consists of rejecting some concept because it is too vaguely defined. In your case, you are claiming that the concept of “Spanish culture” is hopelessly vague as a result of all the cultural changes that have occurred in Spain over time. This argument can also be shown to be ridiculous. For example, just because I can’t tell you where orange ends and red begins on the color spectrum doesn’t mean that the concepts of “orange” and “red” have no meaning. Yes, culture does change over time, but that doesn’t mean that there is no such thing as “culture”.",2016-03-05,1,The_Donald
phukitallneway,"If all you took from that entire clip is that theyre ""desperately"" trying to make a meme of his real name, then its definitely you who are sad. Donald trump is a clown and your country is on the verge of being controlled by him. This joke has gone too far and it shows what a couple buzz words can do to hide actual facts about the man. ""Make America great again""? I mean shit man even that is bad. Hes saying your country is fucked and needs fixing. And by a man whos best defense of even personal criticism is to simply sue everyone. See how that goes once the entire country hates him when he drives you all into oncoming traffic. The guy is orange and wears a fuckin mop on his head for fucks sake. Id say its all just funny but your country unfortunately has a large impact on mine and we got our own issues without a giant orange smug child playin finders keepers with natural resources. Best pray to whatevee god u believe in, or whatever one he tells you he beilieves in today. ",2016-03-01,0,The_Donald
